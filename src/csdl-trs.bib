   Summary = {The EGRET Project at the University of Hawaii is pursuing a research
program designed to investigate evolution in collaborative systems.
Evolution is of central concern due to the exploratory nature of many
CSCW application areas, including software development, document
preparation, issue generation and discussion, and so forth.  In
exploratory domains, the ill-defined or changing nature of both the
problem and an acceptable solution to it impose special demands.  For
example, the criteria for an acceptable solution, or the solution
generation method may be an an emergent property of the exploratory
process.  This paper discusses our research paradigm and initial progress.}

   abstract = {Exploratory collaboration occurs in domains where the structure and process
of group work evolves as an intrinsic part of the collaborative activity.
Traditional database and hypertext structural models do not provide
explicit support for collaborative exploration.  The EGRET framework
defines both a data and a process model along with supporting analysis
techniques that provide novel support for exploratory collaboration.  To do
so, the EGRET framework breaks with traditional notions of the relationship
between schema and instance structure.  In EGRET, schema structure is
viewed as a representation of the current state of consensus among
collaborators, from which instance structure is allowed to depart in a
controlled fashion.  This paper discusses the issues of exploratory
collaboration, the EGRET approach to its support, and the current status of
this research.}

essential to human learning, in particular, human metalearning.  Few
existing learning support systems, however, provide representations which
help the learner make sense of and organize the subject content of
learning, integrate a wide range of classroom activities, (e.g., reading,
reviewing, writing, discussion), and compare and contrast various
viewpoints from individual learners.  It is our primary purpose to
construct an example instance of such a representation, and to show that
useful computational manipulations can be performed on it, and that the
combination of the representation and related computational services can
actually lead to the improved learner's performance on selected
collaborative learning tasks.},

construction processes. It asserts an essential role of knowledge
representation in achieving a high-level collaborative support. Our central
claim is that the presence of an expressive and usable representation,
combined with necessary computational support, can significantly enhance
the learners' performance in understanding the subject content of learning
artifacts, integrating various classroom activities, and relating different
viewpoints held by other learners. First, we propose a representational
framework, called RESRA, which characterizes the thematic structure of
learning and research artifacts. We then develop a computer-based tool,
called CLARE, that facilitates the use of RESRA for various collaborative
learning tasks, such as evaluating existing work (e.g., papers, programs,
design) or constructing new work. We also design a set of experiments which
will allow us to empirically assess the effectiveness of CLARE and our
research claims.},

more symbolically as a repository for knowledge. The goal of URN is to
make the information available through Usenet more useful by using different
perspectives on Usenet and new ways to extract useful data from Usenet.

   YEAR = 1993,
   SUMMARY = {Formal technical review (FTR) encompasses a range of structured,
collaborative methods employing technical personnel to improve the quality
of a software development artifact.  Research shows that FTR, when
appropriately practiced, provides significant benefits. However, research
also shows that FTR introduces substantial new overhead, and that its
cost-effectiveness is easily compromised by a variety of group process
obstacles.  In addition, current FTR practice is difficult and costly to
investigate effectively, and thus many important questions about its nature
and comparative effectiveness remain unanswered.

This document presents a research agenda intended to address problems in
both the practice and research of FTR through CSRS (Collaborative
Software Review System), an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative
work environment. CSRS provides automated support for many time consuming
aspects of FTR, avoids many group process problems inherent in traditional,
manual review, and captures unique, high quality empirical data about the
process and products of FTR.

The research agenda includes:
(1) Controlled experimental laboratory studies on automated FTR support.
(2) Technology transfer of CSRS to selected industrial sites.
(3) Development of a domain-specific version of CSRS for C++ software.
(4) Creation of a CSRS consortium for collaborative FTR research between
    industry and academia.},

   YEAR = 1994,
   Type = {{Ph.D.} Thesis},
   KEYWORDS = {CLARE, Thesis-PhD},
   MONTH = {May},
   ABSTRACT ={This dissertation presents a computer-based collaborative learning
environment, called CLARE, that is based on the theory of learning as
collaborative knowledge building. It addresses the question, "what can a
computer do for a group of learners beyond helping them share information?"

CLARE differs from virtual classrooms and hypermedia systems in three ways.
First, CLARE is grounded on the theory of meaningful learning, which
focuses the role of meta-knowledge in human learning.  Instead of merely
allowing learners to share information, CLARE provides an explicit
meta-cognitive framework, called RESRA, to help learners interpret
information and build knowledge. Second, CLARE defines a new group process,
called SECAI, that guides learners to systematically analyze, relate, and
discuss scientific text through a set of structured steps: summarization,
evaluation, comparison, argumentation, and integration.  Third, CLARE
provides a fine-grained, non-obtrusive instrumentation mechanism that
keeps track of the usage process of its users. Such data forms an important
source of feedback for enhancing the system and a basis for rigorously
studying collaboration learning behaviors of CLARE users.

CLARE was evaluated through sixteen usage sessions involving six groups of
students from two classes.  The experiments consist of a total of about 300
hours of usage and over 80,000 timestamps.  The survey shows that about 70%
of learners think that CLARE provides a novel way of understanding
scientific text, and about 80% of learners think that CLARE provides a
novel way of understanding their peers' perspectives.  The analysis of the
CLARE database and the process data also reveals that learners differ
greatly in theirinterpretations of RESRA, strategies for comprehending the
online text, and understanding of the selected artifact. It also found
that, despite the large amount of time spent on summarization, up to 66% of
these learners often fail to correctly represent important features of
scientific text and the relationships between those features.  Implications
of these findings at the design, empirical, and pedagogical levels are
discussed.},

method to improve software quality have
been well documented, and yet there is a proliferation of the methods in
practice with varying degrees of success. Worse, the same methods are
often practiced inconsistently and the contribution of various review
factors on review outcomes is also not currently understood.

This research proposes a new approach to assess and study the
cost-effectiveness of various review factors. Our basic approach is to
first develop a framework that allows one to classify the similarities
and differences of existing FTR methods from the perspective of their
review processes.
Specifically, the framework looks into important review factors that
characterize a review process, such as the objective of a particular
phase within the review process, the interaction mode among review
participants and the technique being used during the phase.

Second, we will
develop a computer assisted review system, namely, CSRS version 3.0,
that can be used as an experimental testbed for empirically evaluating
different FTR factors that may impact the methods.
Finally, we will design a control experiment to answer an important
initial question concerning the cost-effectiveness of three different
examination techniques commonly used in existing FTR methods: free
review technique, selective test cases technique and stepwise
verification technique.},

   ABSTRACT = {  Design of new computer-based environments to replace or augment
  traditional, manual work procedures is typically problematic due to
  its experimental and embedded nature: the requirements for the
  computer-based version of the task may not be well defined, and the
  outcome of introducing computer-based support may well change the
  nature of the task altogether.

  This paper illustrates these issues through a discussion of the
  evolution in the design of CSRS, an instrumented, computer-supported
  cooperative work environment for formal technical review.  CSRS was
  originally designed in response to well-recognized shortcomings in
  traditional, non-computer-based formal technical review methods.  The
  initial design was thus founded upon a principle-centered basis,
  where the system was oriented toward solving known problems in the
  domain of formal technical review.  Over time, the design has evolved
  toward a more organization-centered basis, in which the system is
  oriented toward support for adoption and use within organizations, even
  if that support conflicts with the \`\`principles'' of formal technical
  review.  We conjecture that such an evolution may be inevitable in
  experimental and embedded design domains. },

that impact upon the effectiveness of these methods?

The approach taken by this research was to first develop a FTR framework,
based on a review of literature in the field.  The framework allows one to
determine the similarities and differences between the review process of
FTR methods, as well as to identify potential review factors.
Specifically, it describes a review method in terms of seven components of
a review process: phase, objective, degree of collaboration, synchronicity,
role, technique, entry/exit criteria.  By looking at the values of
individual components, one can compare and contrast different FTR
methods. Furthermore, by investigating these values empirically, one can
methodically improve the practice of FTR.

Second, a computer based review system, called CSRS, was developed to
implement the framework. The system provides a set of declarative modeling
languages, which allow one to create a wide variety of FTR methods, or to
design experiments to compare the performance of two or more review
methods, or to evaluate a set of review factors within a method.

Finally, this research involved an empirical study using CSRS to
investigate the effectiveness of a group process versus an individual
process in finding program faults.  Two review methods/systems were
implemented using CSRS: EGSM (used by real groups) and EIAM (used by
nominal groups).  The experiment involved 24 groups of students (3 students
per group), each reviewing two sets of source code, once using EGSM and
once using EIAM.  The experiment found that there were no significant
differences in detection effectiveness between the two methods, that
synergy was observed in EGSM but did not contribute significantly to the
total faults found, and that EGSM incurred higher cost than EIAM, but was
significantly more effective in filtering out false positives. }

  extensions that gathered data regarding the characteristics of all

  Flashmail seems to be preferred whenever the message is short, needs to
  be communicated in a short period of time, and when both the recipient
  and the sender are logged into the system and active at the time of
  sending.  In contrast, I found that E-mail was preferred for messages
  that were large (over 400 characters) and non-urgent, or when the
  receiver was either not logged into Flashmail or had been idle for longer
  than 7 minutes.  These results indicate that Flashmail is generally used

In early 1995, the State of Hawaii began work on an ambitious revision to
its telecommunications policy planning process.  A multidisciplinary team
was commissioned to develop a proposal for an iterative, interactive,
computer-mediated collaborative planning process whereby the State's
telecommunications infrastructure plan could be developed and periodically
upgraded to reflect technology and policy shifts in local communities. The
proposal included a sophisticated, CSCW software system called HI-TIME
which would both enact the planning process as well as provide access and
visibility into the planning process for the general public.  In early
1996, the ambitious collaborative planning process, including the
implemented, deployed HI-TIME system, was abandoned in favor of a more
traditional approach. This paper explores the rise and fall of Project
HI-TIME and the lessons it holds for developers of CSCW systems.}

  abstract = {Project LEAP investigates the use of lightweight, empirical,
anti-measurement dysfunction, and portable approaches to software developer
improvement. A lightweight method involves a minimum of process
constraints, is relatively easy to learn, is amenable to integration with
existing methods and tools, and requires only minimal management investment
and commitment.  An empirical method supports measurements that can lead to
improvements in the software developers skill.  Measurement dysfunction
refers to the possibility of measurements being used against the
programmer, so the method must take care to collect and manipulate
measurements in a \`\`safe'' manner. A portable method is one that can be
applied by the developer across projects, organizations, and companies
during her career.

Project LEAP will investigate the strengths and weaknesses of this approach
to software developer improvement in a number of ways. First, it will
enhance and evaluate a LEAP-compliant toolset and method for defect entry
and analysis. Second, it will use LEAP-compliant tools to explore the
quality of empirical data collected by the Personal Software
Process. Third, it will collect data from industrial evaluation of the
toolkit and method. Fourth, it will create component-based versions of
LEAP-compliant tools for defect and time collection and analysis that can
be integrated with other software development environment
software. Finally, Project LEAP will sponsor a web site providing distance
learning materials to support education of software developers in
empirically guided software process improvement. The web site will also
support distribution and feedback of Project LEAP itself.}

  certain kinds of errors in Java programs using JavaWizard
  (JWiz), a static analysis mechanism for Java source code.  JWiz is an
  extensible tool that supports detection of certain commonly occurring
  semantic errors in Java programs.  For this thesis, I used JWiz within a
  research framework designed to reveal (1) knowledge about the kinds of
  errors made by Java programmers, (2) differences among Java programmers
  in the kinds of errors made, and (3) potential avenues for improvement in
  the design and/or implementation of the Java language or environment.

  I performed a four week case study, collecting data from 14 students over
  three programming projects which produced approximately 12,800 lines of
  code.  The JWiz results were categorized into three types: functional
  errors (must be fixed for the program to work properly, maintenance
  errors (program will work, but considered to be bad style), and false
  positives (intended by the developer).  Out of 235 JWiz warnings, there
  were 69 functional errors, 100 maintenance errors, and 66 false
  positives.  The fix times for the functional errors added up to five and
  a half hours, or 7.3 percent of the total amount of time spent debugging
  in test.

  I found that all programmers inject a few of the same mistakes into their
  code, but these are only minor, non-defect causing errors.  I found that
  the types of defects injected vary drastically with no correlation to
  program size or developer experience.  I also found that for those
  developers who make some of the mistakes that JWiz is designed for, JWiz
  can be a great help, saving significant amounts of time ordinarily spent
  tracking down defects in test.}

  Software developers work too hard and yet do not get enough done.  Developing
  high quality software efficiently and consistently is a very difficult
  problem.  Developers and managers have tried many different solutions to
  address this problem.  Recently their focus has shifted from the software
  organization to the individual software developer.  The Personal Software
  Process incorporates many of the previous solutions while focusing on the
  individual software developer.

  I combined ideas from prior research on the Personal Software Process, Formal
  Technical Review and my experiences building automated support for software
  engineering activities to produce the Leap toolkit.  The Leap toolkit is
  intended to help individuals in their efforts to improve their development
  capabilities.  Since it is a light-weight, flexible, powerful, and private
  tool, it allows individual developers to gain valuable insight into their own
  development process. The Leap toolkit also addresses many measurement and
  data issues involved with recording any software development process.

  The main thesis of this work is the Leap toolkit provides a more accurate and
  effective way for developers to collect and analyze their software
  engineering data than manual methods.  To evaluate this thesis I will
  investigate three claims: (1) the Leap toolkit prevents many important errors
  in data collection and analysis; (2) the Leap toolkit supports data
  collection and analyses that are not amenable to manual enactment; and (3)
  the Leap toolkit reduces the level of \`\`collection stage'' errors.  To
  evaluate the first claim, I will show how the design of the Leap toolkit
  effectively prevents important classes of errors shown to occur in prior
  related research. To evaluate the second claim, I will conduct an experiment
  investigating 14 different quantitative time estimation techniques based upon
  historical size data to show that the Leap toolkit is capable of complex
  analyses not possible in manual methods.  To evaluate the third claim, I will
  analyze software developers data and conduct surveys to investigate the level
  of data collection errors.

    Electronic mailing lists are popular Internet information
    sources. Many mailing lists maintain an archive of all
    messages sent to the list which is often searchable using
    keywords. While useful, these archives suffer from the fact
    that they include all messages sent to the list. Because they
    include all messages, the ability of users to rapidly find
    the information they want in the archive is hampered. To
    solve the problems inherent in current mailing list archives,
    I propose a process called condensation whereby one can strip
    out all the extraneous, conversational aspects of the data
    stream leaving only the pearls of interconnected wisdom.

    To explore this idea of mailing list condensation and to test
    whether or not a condensed archive of a mailing list is
    actually better than traditional archives, I propose the
    construction and evaluation of a new software system.  I name
    this system the Mailing list Condensation System or MCS. MCS
    will have two main parts: one which is dedicated to taking
    the raw material from the mailing list and condensing it, and
    another which stores the condensed messages and allows users
    to retrieve them.

    The condensation process is performed by a human editor
    (assisted by a tool), not an AI system. While this adds a
    certain amount of overhead to the maintenance of the
    MCS-generated archive when compared to a traditional archive,
    it makes the system implementation feasible.

    I believe that an MCS-generated mailing list archive
    maintained by an external researcher will be adopted as a
    information resource by the subscribers of that mailing list.
    Furthermore, I believe that subscribers will prefer the
    MCS-generated archive over existing traditional archives of
    the mailing list. This thesis will be tested by a series of
    quantitative and qualitative measures.  }

Programmers who use the PSP gather measurements related to
their own work products and the process by which they were developed,
then use these measures to drive changes to their development
behavior.
After almost three years of
teaching and using the PSP, we have experienced the educational
benefits of the PSP. As researchers, however, we have also uncovered
evidence of certain limitations, which we believe can help improve
appropriate adoption and evaluation of the method by industrial

The software industry and academia believe that software review,
specifically Formal Technical Review (FTR), is a powerful method for
improving the quality of software.
Computer support for FTR reduces the overhead of conducting
reviews for reviewers and managers.
Computer support of FTR also allow for the easy collection of empirical
measurement of process and products of software review.  These measurements
allow researchers or reviewers to gain valuable insights into the review
process.
After looking closely at review metrics, we became aware of the possibility
of measurement dysfunction in formal technical review.  Measurement
dysfunction is a situation in which the act of measurement affects the
organization in a counter-productive fashion, which leads to results
directly counter to those intended by the organization for the measurement.
How can we reduce the threat of measurement dysfunction in software review
without losing the benefits of metrics collection?  Project
LEAP is our attempt
at to answer this question.  This paper present Project Leap's

  Effective program size measurement is difficult to accomplish.  Factors
  such as program implementation language, programmer experience and
  application domain influence the effectiveness of particular size metrics
  to such a degree that it is unlikely that any single size metric will be
  appropriate for all applications. This thesis introduces a tool, LOCC,
  which provides a generic architecture and interface to the production and
  use of different size metrics.  Developers can use the size metrics
  distributed with LOCC or can design their own metrics, which can be
  easily incorporated into LOCC.  LOCC pays particular attention to the
  problem of supporting incremental development, where a work product is
  not created all at once but rather through a sequence of small changes
  applied to previously developed programs.  LOCC requires that developers
  of new size metrics support this approach by providing a means of
  comparing two versions of a program.  LOCC's effectiveness was evaluated
  by using it to count over 50,000 lines of Java code, by soliciting
  responses to a questionnaire sent to users, and by personal reflection on
  the process of using and extending it.  The evaluation revealed that
  users of LOCC found that it assisted them in their development process,
  although there were some improvements which could be made.

The Personal Software Process (PSP) teaches software developers many valuable
software engineering techniques.  Developers learn how to develop high quality
software efficiently and how to accurately estimate the amount of effort it will
take. To accomplish this the PSP forces the developer to follow a very strict
development model, to manually record time, to defect and size data, and analyze
their data.  The PSP appears successful at improving developer performance during
the training, yet there are questions concerning long-term adoption rates and
the accuracy of PSP data.

This paper presents our experiences using the Leap toolkit, an automated tool
to support personal developer improvement.  The Leap toolkit incorporates ideas
from the PSP and group review.  It relaxes some of the constraints in the PSP
and reduces process overhead.  We are using the Leap toolkit in an advanced
software engineering course at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.

Developers often use electronic mailing lists when seeking assistance with a
particular software application. The archives of these mailing lists provide a
rich repository of problem-solving knowledge. Developers seeking a quick answer
to a problem find these archives inconvenient, because they lack efficient
searching mechanisms, and retain the structure of the original conversational
threads which are rarely relevant to the knowledge seeker.

We present a system called MCS which improves mailing list archives through a
process called {\\em condensation}. Condensation involves several tasks:
extracting only messages of longer-term relevance, adding metadata to those
messages to improve searching, and potentially editing the content of the
messages when appropriate to clarify. The condensation process is performed by
a human editor (assisted by a tool), rather than by an artificial intelligence
(AI) system.

We describe the design and implementation of MCS, and compare it to related
systems. We also present our experiences condensing a 1428 message mailing list
archive to an archive containing only 177 messages (an 88\\% reduction). The
condensation required only 1.5 minutes of editor effort per message. The
condensed archive was adopted by the users of the mailing list.

  Software developers work too hard and yet do not get enough done.
  Developing high quality software efficiently and consistently is a very
  difficult problem.  Developers and managers have tried many different
  solutions to address this problem.  Recently their focus has shifted from
  the software organization to the individual software developer.  For
  example, the Personal Software Process incorporates many of the previous
  solutions while focusing on the individual software developer.

  This thesis presents the Leap toolkit, which combines ideas from prior
  research on the Personal Software Process, Formal Technical Review and my
  experiences building automated support for software engineering activities.
  The Leap toolkit is intended to help individuals in their efforts to improve
  their development capabilities.  Since it is a light-weight, flexible,
  powerful, and private tool, it provides a novel way for developers to gain
  valuable insight into their own development process. The Leap toolkit also
  addresses many measurement and data issues involved with recording any
  software development process.

  The main thesis of this work is that the Leap toolkit provides a novel
  tool that allows developers and researchers to collect and analyze
  software engineering data.  To investigate some of the issues of data
  collection and analysis, I conducted a case study of 16 graduate students
  in an advanced software engineering course at the University of Hawaii,
  Manoa.  The case study investigated: (1) the relationship between the
  Leap toolkit's time collection tools and \`\`collection stage'' errors; and
  (2) different time estimation techniques supported by the Leap toolkit.

  The major contributions of this research includes (1) the LEAP design
  philosophy; (2) the Leap toolkit, which is a novel tool for individual
  developer improvement and software engineering research; and (3) the insights
  from the case study about collection overhead, collection error and project
  estimation.}

For several years, we have pursued an initiative called Project LEAP, whose
goal is the improvement of individual developers though lightweight,
empirical, anti-measurement dysfunction, and portable software engineering
tools and methods.
During the Fall of 1999, we performed a case study using the LEAP toolkit
in a graduate software engineering class.  One of the goals of the study
was to evaluate the various analytical estimation methods made available by
the toolkit.  We were curious as to whether a single method would prove
most accurate, or whether the most accurate method would depend upon the
type of project or the specific developer.  To our surprise, we found that,
in most cases, the developer-generated \`\`guesstimates'' were more accurate
than the analytical estimates.
We also found that the PROBE method of the
Personal Software Process, perhaps the most widely
publicized analytical approach to personal effort estimation, was the sixth
most accurate method.  Finally, we found that access to a range of
analytical estimation methods appeared to be useful to developers in
generating their guesstimates and improving them over time. }

tool for assisting with the development of Open Source Software.  It
generates integrated documentation and source code presentations to be

environment for navigating documentation and source code and for posting
annotations.  javaJAM creates relationships between sections of
documentation, source, and related comments and annotations to provide the
necessary cross-referencing to support quick and efficient reviews.
javaJAM was evaluated in a classroom setting.  Student teams posted
projects for team review using javaJAM and found it to be an easy way to

The ICS department of the University of Hawaii has faced problems
surrounding approval code distribution as its enrollment has increased. The
manual system for approval code allocation was time-consuming, ineffective
and inefficient. INCA is designed to automate the task of approval code
allocation, improve the quality of course approval decisions, and decrease
the administrative overhead involved in those decisions.

Based upon informal feedback from department administrators, it appears
that INCA reduces their overhead and makes their life easier. What are the
old problems that are solved by INCA? Does INCA introduce new kinds of
problems for the administrator? What about the students? Are they
completely satisfied with the system? In what ways does the system benefit
the department as a whole?

In this thesis, I will discuss design, implementation and evaluation of
INCA. I will evaluate INCA from the viewpoints of students, administrators,
and the department. I will do an email analysis to prove that INCA reduces
the administrative overheads. I will conduct a user survey to investigate
whether INCA improves the predictability and understandability of
students. Finally, I will analyze the INCA database to extract the
information useful to the departments for course curriculum planning. The
evaluation of INCA will provide us with useful insights for future
improvements of INCA and improving the student experience with academic
systems in general.

The Hardware Subroutine Approach to developing a reconfigurable, custom

subsystem as a direct replacement for a subroutine in a larger program.
The approach provides a framework that helps the developer analyze the
tradeoffs of using hardware acceleration, and a design procedure to guide
the implementation process.  To illustrate the design process a HWS
implementation of a derivative estimation subroutine is described.  In this
context I show how key performance parameters of the HWS can be estimated
in advance of complete implementation and decisions made regarding the
potential benefit of implementation alternatives to program performance
improvement.  Performance of the actual hardware coprocessor is compared to
the software-only implementation and to estimates developed during the
design process.

Disaster management is increasingly a global enterprise for international
organizations,  governmental institutions, and arguably individuals.  The
tempo at which information is  collected and disseminated during natural
and man-made disasters paces the rate and  effectiveness of relief
efforts.  As the Internet becomes a ubiquitous platform for sharing
information, a browser-based application can provide disaster managers a
lightweight  solution for training and control.  A heavyweight solution
might include dedicated  communications, real-time command and control
software and hardware configurations,  and dedicated personnel.  In
contrast, a lightweight solution requires trained personnel  with Internet
access to a server via computers or hand-held devices.  Tsunami Sim
provides asynchronous situational awareness with an interactive, Geographic
Information  System (GIS).  Tsunami Sim is not capable of providing
real-time situational awareness  nor intended to replace or compete with
heavyweight solutions developed for that  purpose.  Rather, Tsunami Sim
will enhance the disaster managers' abilities to train for  and control
disasters in regions where heavyweight solutions are impractical.  For
distributed training, Tsunami Sim will provide deterministic and stochastic
scenarios of  historical and fictional disasters.  Tsunami Sim will be an
open-source, Java application  implemented for maintainability and
extensibility.  United States Pacific Command  (PACOM) located at Camp
Smith, Hawai'i, will enable Tsunami Sim validation and  assessment.

Instead of limiting the business to the local populace, the World Wide Web
gives global access to all companies that have made the transition to
online.  Ideally, the Internet seems to offer vast, untapped markets,
lowers the costs of reaching these markets, and frees businesses from
geographical constraints. Applying this to Hawaii, small companies can now
sell their products in the expanding global marketplace, instead of
restricting themselves to an island economy.

The goal of research on the Vendor Relationship Management (VRM) System
is to explore the requirements for new business process models and
associated technological infrastructure for small local businesses in
Hawaii that wish to exploit the global reach of the Internet.  In order to
understand the requirements and potential of this approach, we had meetings
with different groups of people that included the host of a virtual mall, a
financial service provider, two courier services, and several local
companies.

The interface of the VRM system includes both a vendor and a host
 side. The host side is used by the virtual mall company to send customers
 orders to the various vendors. It can also be used to create and edit
 vendor company information, create and edit vendor product information,
 and enter a contact email address. The vendor side is used by the numerous
 vendors to receive the orders, confirm that the orders have been sent,
 view the customer information, create and edit product information, and
 create and edit contact information.

After creating the first prototype, several experts gave their critiques
of the system. Based on their critiques, we came up with several possible
directions for future research.

   The ICS department of the University of Hawaii has faced problems
surrounding approval code distribution as its enrollment has increased. The
manual system for approval code allocation was time-consuming, ineffective
and inefficient. INCA is designed to automate the task of approval code
allocation, improve the quality of course approval decisions, and decrease
the administrative overhead involved in those decisions.

Based upon informal feedback from department administrators, it appears
that INCA reduces their overhead and makes their life easier. What are the
old problems that are solved by INCA? Does INCA introduce new kinds of
problems for the administrator? What about the students? Are they
completely satisfied with the system? In what ways does the system benefit
the department as a whole?

This thesis discusses the design, implementation and evaluation of INCA. It
evaluates INCA from the viewpoint of the administrator, the students, and
the department. An analysis of emails
indicates that INCA reduces administrative overhead. The results of the
user survey show that three quarters of students believe INCA improved
their course approval predictability and course requirements
understandability. They prefer INCA to old method of requesting approval
codes by email. INCA database analysis provided course demand information
and student statistics useful for departments. This evaluation of INCA from
three different perspectives provides useful insights for future
improvement of INCA and for improving the student experience with academic
systems in general.

Collection and analysis of empirical software project data is central to
modern techniques for improving software quality, programmer productivity,
and the economics of software project development. Unfortunately, barriers
surrounding the cost, quality, and utility of empirical project data
hamper effective collection and application in many software
development organizations.

This paper describes Hackystat, an approach to enabling ubiquitous
collection and analysis of empirical software project data. The approach
rests on three design criteria: data collection and analysis must be
developer-centric rather than management-centric; it must be in-process
rather than between-process, and it must be non-disruptive---it must not
require developers to interrupt their activities to collect and/or analyze
data.  Hackystat is being implemented via an open source, sensor and web
service based architecture.  After a developer instruments their commercial
development environment tools (such as their compiler, editor, version
control system, and so forth) with Hackystat sensors, data is silently and
unobtrusively collected and sent to a centralized web service.  The web
service runs analysis mechanisms over the data and sends email
notifications back to a developer when \`\`interesting'' changes in their
process or product occur.

Our research so far has yielded an initial operational release in daily use
with a small set of sensors and analysis mechanisms, and a research agenda
for expansion in the tools, the sensor data types, and the analyses. Our
research has also identified several critical technical and social
barriers, including: the fidelity of the sensors; the coverage of the
sensors; the APIs exposed by commercial tools for instrumentation; and the
security and privacy considerations required to avoid adoption problems due
to the spectre of \`\`Big Brother''.

It is known that dolphins are capable of understanding 200 "word"
vocabularies with sentence complexity of three or more "words", where
words consist of audio tones or hand gestures. An automated recognition
method of words where a word is a defined whistle, within a
predetermined acceptable degree of variance, could allow words to  be
both easily reproducible by dolphins and identifiable by humans. We
investigate a neural network to attempt to distinguish four
artificially  generated whistles from themselves and from common
underwater  environmental noises, where a whistle consists of four
variations of a  fundamental whistle style. We play these whistle
variations into the  dolphins normal tank environment and then record
from a separate  tank hydrophone. This results in slight differences for
each whistle  variation's spectrogram, the complete collection of which
we use to  form the neural network training set. For a single whistle
variation, the  neural network demonstrates strong output node values,
greater than  0.9 on a scale of 0 to 1. However, for combinations of
"words", the network exhibits poor training
performance and an  inability to distinguish between words. To validate
this, we used a test set of 41 examples, of which only 22 were
correctly classified. This  result suggests that an appropriately
trained backpropagation neural  network using spectrographic analysis as
inputs is a viable means for a  very specific whistle recognition,
however a large degree of whistle  variation will dramatically lower the
performance of the network, past  that required for acceptable
recognition.

The Faulkes Telescope (FT), currently under construction on the summit of
Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii, will provide data from celestial observations to
schools in the United Kingdom and Hawaii. This project, with its unique
goal of building a telescope to be used exclusively for educational
purposes, is a joint venture between groups in the United Kingdom and
Hawaii. Teachers and students will be able to download data that has been
collected by the telescope on a previous occasion or sign up to have the
telescope collect data at a specific time for them. Current plans call for
data from the telescope to be delivered to classrooms in the form of raw
data files and images from processed raw data files. In addition to sharing
use of the telescope, part of the agreement between the UK and Hawaii
groups provides for the UK group to share all software developed for the
project with the Hawaii group. However, though a system for transporting
images to schools is being developed for the UK side, at present there is
no corresponding system for Hawaii. Also, at this point neither the British
nor Hawaii sides have a definite system for storing and transporting raw
data files.

A first step, therefore, toward making the FT useful
for students and teachers in Hawaii is to develop a plan for a complete
system to archive and transport telescope data. It is anticipated that a
plan for this system will include: 1) a specification of the required
hardware components, 2) a description of how data will move in and out of
the system, 3) a definition of the data pathway within the system, and 4) a
description of the data storage requirements (i.e. database). The
development of each of the components of the system will consist of a
discussion of available options followed by a suggestion of the best choice
of action. Development of this system is anticipated to be the topic for a
directed reading/research project to be undertaken during spring,
2002. After the system has been clearly defined there are some additional
questions to be answered. Among the more interesting aspects is the
question of how to present data from the telescope in the most useful and
effective manner to teachers and students.

  Pedagogies such as the Personal Software Process (PSP)
  shift metrics definition, collection, and analysis from
  the organizational level to the individual level.  While
  case study research indicates that the PSP can provide
  software engineering students with empirical support for
  improving estimation and quality assurance, there is
  little evidence that many students continue to use the PSP
  when no longer required to do so.  Our research suggests
  that this \`\`PSP adoption problem'' may be due to two
  problems: the high overhead of PSP-style metrics
  collection and analysis, and the requirement that PSP
  users \`\`context switch'' between product development and
  process recording.  This paper overviews our initial PSP
  experiences, our first attempt to solve the PSP adoption
  problem with the LEAP system, and our current approach
  called Hackystat.  This approach fully automates both data
  collection and analysis, which eliminates overhead and
  context switching. However, Hackystat changes the kind of

Writing high quality software with a minimum of effort is an important
thing to learn. Various personal metric collection processes exist, such as
PSP and Hackystat. However, using the personal metric collection processes
gives only a partial indication of how a programmer stands amongst his
peers.  Personal metrics vary greatly amongst programmers and it is not
always clear what is the "correct" way to develop software.  This paper
compares personal programming characteristics of students in a class
environment. Metrics, such as CK Metrics, have been analyzed and compared
against a set of similar students in an attempt to find the correct or
accepted value for these metrics.  It is our belief that programmers can
gain much, if not, more information from comparing their personal metrics
against other programmers. Preliminary results show that people with more
experience in programming produce different metrics than those with less.

Hackystat is a software development metrics collection tool that focuses on
individual developers.  Hackystat is able to provide a developer with a
personal analysis of his or her unique processes.  Source code
configuration management (SCM) systems, on the other hand, are a means of
storage for source code in a development community and serve as controller
for what each individual may contribute to the community.  We created a
Hackystat sensor for CVS (an SCM system) in the hopes of bridging the gap
between these two very different, yet related software applications.  It
was our hope to use the data we collected to address the issue of
development conflicts that often arise in organizational development
environments.  We found, however, that neither application, Hackystat or
CVS, could be easily reconfigured to our needs.

Unit testing is an important part of software testing that aids in the
discovery of bugs sooner in the software development process.  Extreme
Programming (XP), and its Test First Design technique, relies so heavily upon
unit tests that the first code implemented is made up entirely of
test cases.  Furthermore, XP considers a feature to be completely coded
only when all of its test cases pass.  However, passing all test cases does
not necessarily mean the test cases are good.
<p>
Extreme Coverage (XC) is a new approach that helps to assess and improve the
quality of software by enhancing unit testing.  It extends the XP requirement
that all test cases must pass with the requirement that all defect-prone
testable methods must be invoked by the tests.  Furthermore, a set of flexible
rules are applied to XC to make it as attractive and light-weight as unit
testing is in XP.  One example rule is to exclude all methods containing one
line of code from analysis.  I designed and implemented a new tool, called
JBlanket, that automates the XC measurement process similar to the way that
JUnit automates unit testing.  JBlanket produces HTML reports similar to JUnit
reports which inform the user about which methods need to be tested next.
<p>
In this research, I explore the feasibility of JBlanket, the amount of effort
needed to reach and maintain XC, and the impact that knowledge of XC has on
system implementation through deployment and evaluation in an academic
environment.  Results show that most students find JBlanket to be a useful tool
in developing their test cases, and that knowledge of XC did influence the
manner in which students implemented their systems. However,  more studies are
needed to conclude precisely how much effort is needed to reach and maintain
XC.
<p>
This research lays the foundation for future research directions.  One
direction involves increasing its flexibility and value by expanding and
refining the rules of XC.  Another direction involves tracking XC behavior to
find out when it is and is not applicable.

  An essential component of agile methods such as Extreme Programming is a
  suite of test cases that is incrementally built and maintained throughout
  development.  This paper presents research exploring two questions
  regarding testing in these agile contexts. First, is there a way to
  validate the quality of test case suites in a manner compatible with
  agile development methods?  Second, is there a way to assess and monitor
  the costs of agile test case development and maintenance?  In this paper,
  we present the results of our recent research on these issues. Our
  results include a measure called XC (for Extreme Coverage) which is
  implemented in a system called JBlanket. XC is designed to support
  validation of the test-driven design methodology used in agile
  development. We describe how XC and JBlanket differ from other coverage
  measures and tools, assess their feasibility through a case study in a
  classroom setting, assess its external validity on a set of open source
  systems, and illustrate how to incorporate XC into a more global measure
  of testing cost and quality called Unit Test Dynamics (UTD). We conclude
  with suggested research directions building upon these findings to
  improve agile methods and tools.

The purpose of a collegiate department website is to provide prospective
students, current students, faculty, staff, and other academic and industry
professionals with information concerning the department.  The information
presented on the website should give the user an accurate model of the
department, even as it changes overtime.  Some of these changes include:
adding new faculty members, new students, new courses, etc.  The more
accurately the website models the department, the more aware the website's
users will be of the department.

Traditional collegiate department websites have two primary problems in
creating an accurate model of their department.  First, only a few people,
usually the department webmasters, can add information to the website.
Second, it is difficult to enable website users to be informed of changes
to the website that might be of interest to them.  These two problems
decrease the accuracy of the model and hamper its effectiveness in alerting
users of changes to the website.  As a result, user awareness of the
department is also decreased.

The Collaborative Educational Website (CLEW) is a Java web application
intended to support accurate modeling of a collegiate department.  CLEW is
designed to solve the traditional collegiate department website's two main
problems.  First, it provides interactive services which will allow users
to add various kinds of information to the website.  Secondly, CLEW
addresses the notification problem by providing tailored email
notifications of changes to the website.

CLEW was developed by a Software Engineering class in the Information and
Computer Science Department at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
My role in this development as project leader is to design and
implement the framework for the system.  CLEW currently contains
approximately 28,000 lines of Java code and it contains upwards of
500 web pages.  In the Spring 2003 semester, CLEW replaced the
existing Information and Computer Science Department website.  I
evaluated CLEW to measure its effectiveness as a model of the
department using a pre and post release questionnaire.  I also
evaluated usage data of the CLEW System to assess the functionality
provided by CLEW.

If CLEW provides a more accurate model of a collegiate department,
then the next step is to provide the CLEW framework to other
collegiate departments worldwide.  It is my hope that the users' of
CLEW will get a clue about their department!

(e) a possible approach to calculating the distribution of package "ages" and days spent in the
various workflow states, along with potential issues with the representation of
"package age" based upon the current approach to package
promotion.

The report illustrates how our current approach to analysis can yield
descriptive perspectives on the MDS development process. It provides a first
step toward more prescriptive, analytic models of the MDS software development
process by providing insights into the potential uses and limitations of MDS

  Measurement definition, collection, and analysis is an essential

  essential component of the software engineering curriculum.  However,
  providing students with practical experience with measurement in a

  measurement collection and analysis using the Hackystat system with
  special features for classroom use. We deployed this system in two
  software engineering classes at the University of Hawaii during Fall,

Software development is slow, expensive and error prone, often resulting in
products with a large number of defects which cause serious problems in
usability, reliability and performance. To combat this problem, software
measurement provides a systematic and empirically-guided approach to
control and improve development processes and final products. Experience
has shown excellent results so long as measurement programs are
conscientiously implemented and followed. However, due to the high cost
associated with metrics collection and difficulties in metrics
decision-making, many organizations fail to benefit from measurement
programs.

In this dissertation, I propose a new measurement approach --
software project telemetry. It addresses the "metrics collection
cost problem" through highly automated measurement machinery -- sensors
are used to collect metrics automatically and unobtrusively. It addresses
the "metrics decision-making problem" through intuitive high-level visual
perspectives on software development that support in-process,
empirically-guided project management and process improvement. Unlike
traditional metrics approaches which are primarily based on historical
project databases and focused on model-based project comparison, software
project telemetry emphasizes project dynamics and in-process control. It
combines both the precision of traditional project management techniques
and the flexibility promoted by agile community.

The main claim of this dissertation is that software project telemetry
provides an effective approach to (1) automated metrics collection, and (2)
in-process, empirically-guided software development process problem
detection and analysis. Three case studies will be
conducted to evaluate the claim in different software development
environments:

(1) A pilot case study with student users in software engineering classes to
(a) test drive the software project telemetry system in preparation for the
next two full-scale case studies, and (b) gather the students' opinions
when the adoption of the technology is mandated by their instructor.

(2) A case study in CSDL to (a) use software project telemetry to
investigate and improve its build process, and (b) evaluate the technology
at the same time in CSDL (an environment typical of traditional software
development with close collaboration and centralized decision-making).

(3) A case study at Ikayzo with open-source project developers
(geologically-dispersed volunteer work and decentralized decision-making)
to gather their opinions about software project telemetry.

The time frame of this research is as follows. The implementation of the
software project telemetry system is complete and deployed. I have finished
the first pilot case study. I will start both the second and third case
studies from October 2005, and they will last 4 - 6 months. I wish to
defend my research in May or August 2006 if everything goes according to
plan.

The high performance computing (HPC) community is increasingly
aware that traditional low-level, execution-time measures for assessing
high-end computers, such as flops/second, are not adequate for
understanding the actual productivity of such systems. In response,
researchers and practitioners are exploring new measures and assessment
procedures that take a more wholistic approach to high performance
productivity. In this paper, we present an approach to understanding and
assessing development-time aspects of HPC productivity. It involves the use
of Hackystat for automatic, non-intrusive collection and analysis of six
measures: Active Time, Most Active File,
Command Line Invocations, Parallel and Serial Lines of Code, Milestone

these measures through a case study of small-scale HPC software development.

Imagine that your project manager has budgeted 200 person-hours for the
next month to inspect newly created source code. Unfortunately, in order to
inspect all of the documents adequately, you estimate that it will take 400
person-hours. However, your manager refuses to increase the budgeted
resources for the inspections. How do you decide which documents to inspect
and which documents to skip? Unfortunately, the classic definition of
inspection does not provide any advice on how to handle this situation. For
example, the notion of entry criteria used in Software Inspection
determines when documents are ready for inspection rather
than if it is needed at all.

My research has investigated how to prioritize inspection resources and
apply them to areas of the system that need them more. It is commonly
assumed that defects are not uniformly distributed across all documents in
a system, a relatively small subset of a system accounts for a relatively
large proportion of defects. If inspection resources are
limited, then it will be more effective to identify and inspect the
defect-prone areas.

To accomplish this research, I have created an inspection process called
Priority Ranked Inspection (PRI). PRI uses software product and development
process measures to distinguish documents that are \`\`more in need of
inspection'' (MINI) from those \`\`less in need of inspection'' (LINI). Some
of the product and process measures include: user-reported defects, unit
test coverage, active time, and number of changes. I hypothesize that the
inspection of MINI documents will generate more defects with a higher
severity than inspecting LINI documents.

My research employed a very simple exploratory study, which includes
inspecting MINI and LINI software code and checking to see if MINI code
inspections generate more defects than LINI code inspections. The results
of the study provide supporting evidence that MINI documents do contain
more high-severity defects than LINI documents. In addition, there is some
evidence that PRI can provide developers with more information to help
determine what documents they should select for inspection.

  In this paper we propose a new streaming technique to study software

  activities such as edit, compilation, testing, debug and deployment etc.
  All these activities contribute to development stream, which is a
  collection of software development activities in time order. Development
  stream can help us replay and reveal software development process at a
  later time without too much hassle. We developed a system called Zorro to
  generate and analyze development stream at Collaborative Software
  Development Laboratory in University of Hawaii. It is built on the top of
  Hackystat, an in-process automatic metric collection
  system developed in the CSDL.  Hackystat sensors continuously collect
  development activities and send them to a centralized data store for
  processing. Zorro reads in all data of a project and constructs stream
  from them. Tokenizers are chained together to divide development stream
  into episodes (micro iteration) for classification with rule engine. In
  this paper we demonstrate the analysis on Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  with this framework.

Measurement is an important aspect of Software Engineering as it is the
foundation of predictable and controllable software project
execution. Measurement is essential for assessing actual project progress,
establishing baselines and validating the effects of improvement or
controlling actions.

The work performed in this thesis is based on Hackystat, a fully automated
measurement framework for software engineering processes and
products. Hackystat is designed to unobtrusively measure a wide range of
metrics relevant to software development and collect them in a centralized
data repository.  Unfortunately, it is not easy to interpret, analyze and
visualize the vast data collected by Hackystat in such way that it can
effectively be used for software project control.

A potential solution to that problem is to integrate Hackystat with the GQM
(Goal / Question / Metric) Paradigm, a popular approach for goal-oriented,
systematic definition of measurement programs for software-engineering
processes and products.  This integration should allow the goal-oriented
use of the metric data collected by Hackystat and increase its usefulness
for project control.  During the course of this work, this extension to
Hackystat which is later called hackyCGQM is implemented. As a result,
hackyCGQM enables Hackystat to be used as a Software Project Control Center
(SPCC) by providing purposeful high-level representations of the
measurement data.

Another interesting side-effect of the combination of Hackystat and
hackyCGQM is that this system is able to perform fully automated
measurement and analysis cycles. This leads to the development of cGQM, a
specialized method for fully automated, GQM based measurement programs.  As
a summary, hackyCGQM seeks to implement a completely automated GQMbased
measurement framework. This high degree of automation is made possible by
limiting the implemented measurement programs to metrics which can be
measured automatically, thus sacrificing the ability to use arbitrary
metrics.

Software development is slow, expensive and error prone, often resulting in
products with a large number of defects which cause serious problems in
usability, reliability, and performance. To combat this problem, software
measurement provides a systematic and empirically-guided approach to
control and improve software development processes and final
products. However, due to the high cost associated with \`\`metrics
collection'' and difficulties in \`\`metrics decision-making,'' measurement
is not widely adopted by software organizations.

This dissertation proposes a novel metrics-based program called \`\`software
project telemetry'' to address the problems. It uses software sensors to
collect metrics automatically and unobtrusively. It employs a
domain-specific language to represent telemetry trends in software product
and process metrics. Project management and process improvement decisions
are made by detecting changes in telemetry trends and comparing trends
between different periods of the same project. Software project telemetry
avoids many problems inherent in traditional metrics models, such as the
need to accumulate a historical project database and ensure that the
historical data remain comparable to current and future projects.

The claim of this dissertation is that software project telemetry provides
an effective approach to (1) automated metrics collection and analysis, and
(2) in-process, empirically-guided software development process problem
detection and diagnosis. Two empirical studies were carried out to evaluate
the claim: one in software engineering classes, and the other in the
Collaborative Software Development Lab. The results suggested that software
project telemetry had acceptably-low metrics collection and analysis
overhead, and that it provided decision-making value at least in the
exploratory context of the two studies.

If empirical software engineering is to grow as a valid scientific
endeavor, the ability to acquire, use, share, and compare data collected
from a variety of sources must be encouraged. This is necessary to validate
the formal models being developed within computer science. However, within
the empirical software engineering community this has not been easily
accomplished. This paper analyses experience from a number of projects, and
defines the issues, which include the following: (1) How should data,
testbeds, and artifacts be shared? (2) What limits should be placed on who
can use them and how? How does one limit potential misuse? (3) What is the
appropriate way to credit the organization and individual that spent the
effort collecting the data, developing the testbed, and building the
artifact? (4) Once shared, who owns the evolved asset?  As a solution to
these issues, the paper proposes a framework for an empirical software
engineering artifact license, which is intended to address the needs for
both creator and user of such artifacts and should foster a market in
making available and using such artifacts. If this license framework for
sharing software engineering artifacts is commonly accepted, it is
considered that it should encourage artifact owners to make the artifacts
accessible to others (gaining credit is more likely and misuse is less
likely), and it may be easier for other researchers to request artifacts
since there will be a well-defined protocol for how to deal with relevant
matters.

Software engineers generally agree that code reviews reduce development
costs and improve software quality by finding defects in the early stages
of software development. In addition, code review software tools help the
code review process by providing a more efficient means of collecting and
analyzing code review data. On the other hand, software organizations that
conduct code reviews often do not utilize these review tools. Instead, most
organizations simply use paper or text editors to support their code review
processes. Using paper or a text editor is potentially less useful than
using a review tool for collecting and analyzing code review data.

In this research, I attempted to address the problems of previous code
review tools by creating a lightweight and flexible review tool. This
review tool that I have developed, called "Jupiter", is an Eclipse IDE
Plug-In. I believe the Jupiter Code Review Tool is more efficient at
collecting and analyzing code review data than the text-based approaches.

To investigate this hypothesis, I have constructed a methodology to compare
the Jupiter Review Tool to the text-based review approaches. I carried out
a case study using both approaches in a software engineering course with 19
students.

The results provide some supporting evidence that Jupiter is more useful
and more usable than the text-based code review, requires less overhead
than the text-based review, and appears to support long-term adoption.

The major contributions of this research are the Jupiter design philosophy,
the Jupiter Code Review Tool, and the insights from the case study
comparing the text-based review to the Jupiter-based review.

Stream Analysis (SDSA). Software Development Stream Analysis is a generic framework

behaviors. An early pilot validation study found that Zorro works very well in practice, with Zorro
recognizing the software development episodes of TDD with 88.4\\% accuracy. After this pilot
study, I improved Zorro system's inferencing rules and evaluation mechanism as part of my collaborative

This report presents the results from a classroom evaluation of Hackystat
by ICS 413 and ICS 613 students at the end of Fall, 2006.  The students had
used Hackystat-UH for approximately six weeks at the time of the
evaluation.  The survey requests their feedback regarding the installation,
configuration, overhead of use, usability, utility, and future use of the
Hackystat-UH configuration. This classroom evaluation is a semi-replication
of an evaluation performed on Hackystat by ICS 413 and 613 students at the
end of Fall, 2003, which is reported in "Results from the 2003 Classroom
Evaluation of Hackystat-UH".  As the Hackystat system has changed
significantly since 2003, some of the evaluation questions were changed.
The data from this evaluation, in combination with the data from the 2003
evaluation, provide an interesting perspective on the past, present, and
possible future of Hackystat.  Hackystat has increased significantly in
functionality since 2003, which has enabled the 2006 usage to more closely
reflect industrial application, and which has resulted in significantly
less overhead with respect to client-side installation. On the other hand,
results appear to indicate that this increase in functionality has resulted
in a decrease in the usability and utility of the system, due to
inadequacies in the server-side user interface.  Based upon the data, the
report proposes a set of user interface enhancements to address the
problems raised by the students, including Ajax-based menus and parameters,
workflow based organization of the user interface, real-time display for
ongoing project monitoring, annotations, and simplified data exploration
facilities.

empirical research on low-level software processes often yields conflicting
results. A significant threat to the validity of the empirical studies on
low-level software processes is that they lack the ability to rigorously
assess process conformance. That is to say, the degree to which developers
follow the low-level software processes can not be evaluated.

In order to improve the quality of empirical research on low-level software
processes, I developed a technique called Software Development Stream
Analysis (SDSA) that can infer development behaviors using automatically
collected in-process software metrics. The collection of development
activities is supported by Hackystat, a framework for automated software
process and product metrics collection and analysis. SDSA abstracts the
collected software metrics into a software development stream, a
time-series data structure containing time-stamped development events. It
then partitions the development stream into episodes, and then uses a
rule-based system to infer low-level development behaviors exhibited in
episodes.

With the capabilities provided by Hackystat and SDSA, I developed the Zorro
software system to study a specific low-level software process called
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Experience reports have shown that TDD can
greatly improve software quality with increased developer productivity, but
empirical research findings on TDD are often mixed. An inability to
rigorously assess process conformance is a possible explanation. Zorro can
rigorously assess process conformance to a specific operational definition
for TDD, and thus enable more controlled, comparable empirical studies.

My research has demonstrated that Zorro can recognize the low-level
software development behaviors that characterize TDD. Both the pilot and
classroom case studies support this conclusion. The industrial case study
shows that the automated data collection and development behavior inference
has the potential to be useful for researchers.

The Personal Environmental Tracker (PET) is a proposed
system for helping people to track their impact on the
environment, and to make changes to reduce that impact,
creating a personal feedback loop. PET consists of sensors
that collect data such as home electricity or gasoline usage
and send it to a database for analysis and presentation to the
user. By collecting data from diverse sources, PET can help
users decide what aspect of their lives they should make
changes in first to maximize their reduction in
environmental impact. PET's open architecture will allow
other ubiquitous sustainability researchers to leverage the
infrastructure for research in sensors, data analysis, or
presentation of data.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development named for its most
visible characteristic: the design and implementation of test cases prior
to the implementation of the code required to make them pass. Many claims
have been made for TDD: that it can improve implementation as well as
design quality, that it can improve productivity, that it results in 100\\%
coverage, and so forth.  However, research to validate these claims has
yielded mixed and sometimes contradictory results.  We believe that at
least part of the reason for these results stems from differing
interpretations of the TDD development style, along with an inability to
determine whether programmers actually follow whatever definition of
TDD is in use.

Zorro is a system designed to automatically determine whether a developer
is complying with an operational definition of Test-Driven Development
(TDD) practices.  Automated recognition of TDD can benefit the software
development community in a variety of ways, from inquiry into the \`\`true
nature'' of TDD, to pedagogical aids to support the practice of test-driven
development, to support for more rigorous empirical studies on the
effectiveness of TDD in both laboratory and real world settings.

This paper describes the Zorro system, its operational definition of TDD,
the analyses made possible by Zorro, and two empirical evaluations of the
system.  Our research shows that it is possible to define an operational
definition of TDD that is amenable to automated recognition, and
illustrates the architectural and design issues that must be addressed in
order to do so.  Zorro has implications not only for the practice of TDD,
but also for software engineering \`\`micro-process'' definition and
recognition through its parent framework, Software Development Stream
Analysis.

For empirical software engineering to reach its fullest potential, we must
develop effective, experiential approaches to learning about it in a
classroom setting.  In this paper, we report on a case study involving a
new approach to classroom-based empirical software engineering called the
\`\`Software ICU''.  In this approach, students learn about nine empirical
project \`\`vital signs'' and use the Hackystat Framework to put their
projects into a virtual \`\`intensive care unit'' where these vital signs can
be assessed and monitored.  We used both questionnaire and log data to gain
insight into the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Our evaluation
provides both quantitative and qualitative evidence concerning the overhead
of the system; the relative utility of different vital signs; the frequency
of use; and the perceived appropriateness outside of the classroom
setting. In addition to benefits, we found evidence of measurement
dysfunction induced directly by the presence of the Software ICU. We
compare these results to case studies we performed in 2003 and 2006 using
the Hackystat Framework but not the Software ICU.  We use these findings to
orient future research on empirical software engineering both inside and

While I am not proposing to be able to infer a complete and correct software process model, my system will provide its users with a formal description of recurrent behaviors in their software development. The proposed contributions of my research will include:  (1) the implementation of a system aiding in discovery of novel software process knowledge through the analysis of fine-grained software process and product data;

In software engineering, the importance of measurement is well understood, and many efficient software development metrics have been developed to help measurement. However, as the number of metrics increases, the effort required to collect data, analyze them and interpret the results quickly becomes overwhelming. This problem is even more critical in educational approaches regarding empirical software engineering.

The Software Intensive Care Unit is a new approach to facilitating software measurement and control with multiple software development metrics. It uses the Hackystat system to achieve automated data collection and analysis, then uses the collected analysis data to create a monitoring interface for multiple \`\`vital signs''. A vital sign is a wrapper of a software metric with an easy to use presentation. It consists of a historical trend and a newest state value, both of which are colored according to the \`\`health'' state.

My research deployed and evaluated the Software ICU in a senior-level software engineering course. Students' usage was logged in the system, and a survey was conducted. The results provide supporting evidence that Software ICU does help students in course project development and project team organization. In addition, the results of the study also discover some limitations of the system, including inappropriate vital sign presentation and measurement dysfunction.

The University of Hawaii at Manoa has set the goals of reducing its
electricity usage by 30 percent by 2012 and 50 percent by 2015 (based on a
2003 benchmark). A variety of tactics will be required to meet these
aggressive goals. One promising technique is to encourage the occupants of
buildings to reduce their electricity usage.  There are a variety of
possible interventions that may encourage occupants to reduce their
electricity usage. To assess the relative effectiveness of the
interventions, we plan a series of experiments in Saunders. However, the
participants of each experiment will be the occupants of Saunders, rather
than a set of participants recruited anew for each experiment. We expect
two negative consequences of the continuity of the subjects: reduced
subject interest/enthusiasm, and diminishing conservation returns.

The "Smart Grid" represents a new vision for
the electrical infrastructure of the United States, whose goals include
more active participation by consumers, new generation and storage options
including renewable energy, and new products, services, and markets.  To
reach its full potential, the Smart Grid must provide information to
consumers in a way that enables positive, sustained changes to
energy-related behaviors.

The central question to be pursued in this research proposal is: What kinds of
  information, provided in what ways and at what times, enables consumers
  to make positive, sustained changes to their energy consumption
  behaviors?  Prior research indicates that such changes can potentially
be motivated by an appropriate combination of personalized information,
general and specific commitments, achievable goals, social reinforcement,
feedback, and financial incentives.

This project will develop a collection
of open source components called WattBlocks, which  will provide novel and
useful scientific infrastructure for investigating the ways in which
energy-related information can affect human behavior. The project will also
develop eSpheres, a novel social networking application that provides users
with access to energy-related communities at configurable levels of
scale. The combination of WattBlocks and eSpheres will lower the technological
efforts required for empirical, replicable studies of human energy-related
behaviors.

The project will use this infrastructure in a series of two case studies, one
involving campus dormitory energy competitions and one involving community
home energy challenges.  The project will investigate a number of
important research questions, including: (1) What are the requirements
for consumer-facing, open source, scientific energy information
infrastructure? (2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of a dedicated
social network technology like eSpheres for energy behavior change? (3)
What combination of behavioral change motivators, under what conditions,
induce positive change? (4) What factors influence the sustainability of
these changes? (5) What is the influence of energy data feedback latency
(i.e. 1 minute, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day) on behavioral change?

This thesis investigates a new way to take advantage of RDF metadata to
support Collaborative Software Development. RDF metadata helps developers
overcome typical problems in iterative software development, such as:
exceptions thrown at run-time; making design and implementation decisions
within previously unknown domains; and usage of previously unknown tools or
libraries. Solutions usually consist of searching for suggestions from
forum posts, source code of similar projects, direct contact with specific
experts, etc.  The main problems with this approach are the time wasted in
manually detecting the searched info from unstructured documents, the low
effectiveness of search engines, and the lack of information about the
actual expertise of the directly contacted people.

In contrast, having info about projects and issues semantically structured
with RDF metadata can speed up detection of the searched details.  Dynamic
creation of RDF links with external similar RDF metadata allows users to
avoid searching or analyzing search results.  Finally, metadata about users
including quality measures coming from a trustworthy source such as
Telemetry can allow the user to trust the actual developer's
expertise. Such RDF metadata and links, together with HTTP URIs, is
provided by the Hackystat LinkedSensorData (LiSeD) service.

Service-oriented computing is considered as a successful approach building
large-scale software systems, spanning the internet, and globally improving
software reuse. Service-oriented architectures are complex and hard to
maintain. A service may run on many machines, and single machines may host
many services. The concept of distributed composition of services hides a
huge amount of complexity in the management of the service-oriented
architecture. Users have to deal with complex configuration of services to
achieve functional and quality requirements, thus the complexity of the
system requires a lot of administrator-interference. Despite the effort of
the administrator, the configuration may not be good enough. It is hard for
an administrator to monitor individual services and the service-oriented
system to determine if the system is running optimal. Therefore a growing
trend for autonomic service-oriented systems has emerged. In mid-october
2001, IBM released a manifesto that the main obstacle to further progress
in the IT industry is a looming software complexity crisis. The manifesto
claimed that the difficulty of managing today's computer systems goes well
beyond the administration of individual software environments. Computing
system's complexity appears to be approaching the limits of human
capability, and there will be no way to make timely, decisive responses to
the rapid stream of changing and conflicting. This dissertation discusses
autonomic computing in service-oriented computing. We present a framework
that builds the foundation for self-healing, self-reconfiguration,
self-optimization and selfprotecting service-oriented systems. We apply and
implement the framework to Hackystat, an Open Source Software developed at
University of Hawaii. Furthermore we discuss the role of service-oriented
computing in autonomic computing, which plays a fundamental role for the
relationship between autonomic elements. At the end, we achieved to provide
a global overview in the domain of autonomic and service-oriented computing
and how to combine them in bidirectional ways. We implemented an open
source framework called, Hackystat Service Manager, for achieving an
autonomic service-oriented architecture in Hackystat in the scope of Google
Summer of Code, which can be evolved and evaluated or adapted to any other
service-oriented system.

The world is in the grip of a crisis in the way energy is produced and consumed. Climate change represents a huge threat to the modern way of life, particularly for island communities like Hawaii. Many changes to our energy system will be required to resolve the crisis, and one promising part of the solution is reducing energy usage through changes in behavior. Energy usage in similar homes can differ by a factor of two to four times, demonstrating the potential contribution of behavior change to the crisis.

This research project seeks to find ways to foster sustainable changes in behavior that lead to reduced energy usage. The research will be conducted in the context of a dorm energy competition on the UH Manoa campus in October 2010. Power meters will be installed on each floor of two freshmen residence halls. Each floor will compete to use the least energy during the 4 week competition.

A competition website will be created, where participants can log in to view near-realtime data about their floor's power usage, and also select from a variety of tasks to perform. Each task is designed to increase the participant's energy literacy (knowledge, positive attitudes, and behaviors related to energy), and a certain number of points are assigned for the completion of each task. The points provide a parallel competition to motivate participants to perform the tasks. Prizes will be awarded to floors using the least energy, and participants obtaining the most points.

Several research questions will be investigated using the data collected, including how energy usage changed after the competition is over, whether the website tasks affected energy literacy, and whether floors that had higher energy literacy had more sustained energy conservation after the competition was complete. The research questions will be investigated using energy data from the meters, log files from the website, and an energy literacy survey administered before and after the competition.

Because of our ever-increasing population and our limited natural resources, improving the energy literacy of the population is becoming increasingly important.  A way to promote these habits is to hold energy competitions to see who can reduce their energy usage the most.  A popular place to hold these competitions are in University dorms, where students are making the transition from living with their parents to living on their own.  Holding these competitions are a great way to educate the student population, but the development of the competition can be costly.  Besides prizes for the winning individuals/dorms, creating and maintaining a development website can take a lot of time.  Some groups have turned to software development firms that provide the software and hardware, but at a cost.

We propose a system called Makahiki that will provide a free, open-source, and easy to implement solution.  Using other open source tools such as WattDepot, we aim to create a configurable package for organizations who hope to hold their own energy competitions.  To test our implementation, we will be holding a dorm energy competition here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in October 2011.  We will also test the configurability of our system by implementing another organization's dorm energy competition website.

  WattDepot is an open source, Internet-based, service-oriented framework
  for collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of energy data.
  WattDepot differs from other energy management solutions in one or more
  of the following ways: it is not tied to any specific metering
  technology; it provides high-level support for meter aggregation and data
  interpolation; it supports carbon intensity analysis; it is
  architecturally decoupled from the underlying storage technology; it
  supports both hosted and local energy services; it can provide near-real
  time data collection and feedback; and the software is open source and
  freely available.  In this paper, we introduce the framework, provide
  examples of its use, and discuss its application to research and
  understanding of the Smart Grid.

Enterprise-scale energy data collection and analysis is becoming increasingly important with the advent of the "Smart" grid. We have developed and released an open source, sensor-based system called WattDepot for collecting, storing and analyzing energy data to fill this niche that is greater than individual households but less than entire utility grids. WattDepot is designed to allow data collection from a wide variety of energy production and consumption devices, and to support diverse visualizations and delivery of the data. We are using WattDepot to support a campus dormitory energy competition for Fall 2010. Since the process of selecting, purchasing, and installing the meters is ongoing, we have developed an end-to-end simulation of dorm energy to ensure that the WattDepot software sensors would work with any of the chosen meters. WattDepot's sensor-based, service-oriented architecture makes it useful to a wide variety of energy application domains.

A process defines a set of routines which allow one to organize, manage and improve activities in order to reach a goal. With expert intuition and a-priori knowledge, software processes have been modeled for a long time, resulting in the Waterfall, Spiral and other development models. Later, with the wide use of SCM systems and the public availability of primitive software process artifact trails, formal methods such as Petri Nets, State Machines and others have been applied to the problem of recurrent process discovery and control. Recent advances in metrics effort, increased use of continuous integration, and extensive documentation of the performed process make information-rich fine-grained software process artifacts trails available for analysis. This fine-grained data has the potential to shed new light on the software process. In this work I propose to investigate an automated technique for the discovery and characterization of recurrent behaviors in software development - "programming habits" either on an individual or a team level.

We designed the Kukui Cup challenge to foster energy conservation and increase energy literacy. Based on a review of the literature, the challenge combined a variety of elements into an overall game experience, including: real-time energy feedback, goals, commitments, competition, and prizes.

We designed a software system called Makahiki to provide the online portion of the Kukui Cup challenge. Energy use was monitored by smart meters installed on each floor of the Hale Aloha residence halls on the University of Hawai\`i at Manoa campus.

In October 2011, we ran the UH Kukui Cup challenge for the over 1000 residents of the Hale Aloha towers. To evaluate the Kukui Cup challenge, I conducted three experiments: challenge participation, energy literacy, and energy use.

Many residents participated in the challenge, as measured by points earned and actions completed through the challenge website. I measured the energy literacy of a random sample of Hale Aloha residents using an online energy literacy questionnaire administered before and after the challenge. I found that challenge participants' energy knowledge increased significantly compared to non-challenge participants. Positive self-reported energy behaviors increased after the challenge for both challenge participants and non-participants, leading to the possibility of passive participation by the non-challenge participants.

I found that energy use varied substantially between and within lounges over time. Variations in energy use over time complicated the selection of a baseline of energy use to compare the levels during and after the challenge. The best team reduced its energy use during the challenge by 16\\%. However, team energy conservation did not appear to correlate to participation in the challenge, and there was no evidence of sustained energy conservation after the challenge. The problems inherent in assessing energy conservation using a baseline call into question this common practice.

My research has generated several contributions, including: a demonstration of increased energy literacy as a result of the challenge, the discovery of fundamental problems with the use of baselines for assessing energy competitions, the creation of two open source software systems, and the creation of an energy literacy assessment instrument.

Due to rising costs and the questionable future of our non-renewable energy reserves,
individuals need to become aware of their energy usage. In order to instill these habits earlier,
organizations have held energy competitions to promote the reduction of energy. This also has the
side effect of reducing the energy cost to the organization holding the competition. Typically, these
competitions are held in colleges and universities and there are companies that can provide hardware
and software to support them. However, since such solutions can be expensive, we would like a free,
open source solution that can be used by any organization.
We created Makahiki to be an open source framework for sustainability competitions. We
also designed it to be a platform for researchers to investigate user behaviors during an energy competition. However, in order to validate our design, we need to evaluate and test our design. During
the course of development, we had three evaluation phases. In the mockup phase, we validated our
design before doing any implementation. In the onboarding phase, we investigated how individuals
will interact with the system when they visit it for the first time. Finally, in the beta phase, we simulated the competition on a much smaller scale in order to observe how Makahiki might be used in
an actual competition. Following these evaluations, Makahiki was used to support the 2011 Kukui
Cup, which was held in mid-October.
In summary, we claim the following contributions:
1. An open source system for creating serious games for energy competitions.
2. A research platform on which researchers can observe user behavior during energy competitions.
3. A methodology for evaluating and testing serious games that involve competitions over a
period of time.

  The rising cost, increasing scarcity, and environmental impact of fossil

Within the field of software repository mining
(MSR) researchers deal with a problem of discovery of interesting
and actionable information about software projects. It is
a common practice to perform analyzes on the various levels
of abstraction of change events, for example by aggregating
change-events into time-series. Following this, I investigate
the applicability of SAX-based approximation and indexing of
time-series with tf*idf weights in order to discover recurrent
behaviors within development process. The proposed workflow
starts by extracting and aggregating of revision control data
and followed by reduction and transformation of aggregated
data into symbolic space with PAA and SAX. Resulting SAX
words then grouped into dictionaries associated with software
process constraints known to influence behaviors, such as time,
location, employment, etc. These, in turn, are investigated with
the use of tf*idf statistics as a dissimilarity measure in order
to discover behavioral patterns.
As a proof of the concept I have applied this technique to
software process artifact trails corresponding to Android OS1
development, where it was able to discover recurrent behaviors
in the \`\`new code lines dynamics'' before and after release.
By building a classifier upon these behaviors, I was able to
successfully recognize pre- and post-release behaviors within
the same and similar sub-projects of Android OS.}

The state of Hawaii is more dependent on oil than any other state in the nation, using it for most electricity generation as well as transportation. The state-sponsored Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative calls for Hawaii to sharply reduce this dependence, obtaining 70 percent of its energy from clean energy sources by 2030. The University of Hawaii is playing a major role in this effort by conducting research, education, and workforce training in energy and sustainability. The project considers both theoretical and practical aspects of response, control and status on a local, interconnected sub-system of the grid and elucidates its behavior when distributed renewable energy sources are added. The result will be a smart, sustainable microgrid. Four interlinked research projects will be integrated into a graduate and undergraduate education program on smart grids, renewable energy, and energy efficiency.

Satisfying the radically different requirements and operating assumptions of the next generation smart grid requires new kinds of software that enable research and experimentation into the ways that electrical energy production and consumption can be collected, analyzed, visualized, and provided to consumers. Since 2009, we have been designing, implementing, and evaluating an open source software \`\`stack'' to facilitate this research. This software stack consists of two custom systems called WattDepot and Makahiki, along with the open source components they rely upon (Java, Restlet, Postgres, Python, Django, Memcache). In this paper, we detail the novel features of WattDepot and Makahiki, our experiences using them for research and education, and additional ways they can be used for next generation energy research and education.

  The Kukui Cup project investigates the use of \`\`meaningful play'' to facilitate energy awareness, conservation and behavioral change.  Each Kukui Cup Challenge combines real world and online environments in an attempt to combine information technology, game mechanics, educational pedagogy, and incentives in a synergistic and engaging fashion.  We challenge players to: (1) acquire more sophistication about energy concepts and (2) experiment with new behaviors ranging from micro (such as turning off the lights or installing a CFL) to macro (such as taking energy-related courses, joining environmental groups, and political/social advocacy.)

 To inform the design of the inaugural 2011 Kukui Cup, we relied heavily on prior collegiate energy competitions, of which there have been over 150 in the past few years.  Published accounts of these competitions indicate that they achieve dramatic reductions in energy usage (a median of 22\\%) and cost savings of tens of thousands of dollars.  In our case, the data collected from the 2011 Kukui Cup was generally in agreement, with observed energy reductions of up to 16\\% when using data collection and analysis techniques typical to these competitions.  However, our analysis process caused us to look more closely at the methods employed to produce outcome data for energy competitions, with unexpected results.

 We now believe that energy competitions make significant unwarranted assumptions about the data they collect and the way they analyze them, which calls into question both the accuracy of published results from this literature and their effectiveness as serious games.  We believe a closer examination of these issues by the community can help improve the design not only of future energy challenges, but other similar forms of serious games for sustainability.

 In this paper, we describe the Kukui Cup, the design myths it uncovered, and the fixes we propose to improve future forms of meaningful play with respect to energy in particular and serious games in general.

This paper presents the Kukui Cup challenge, a serious game designed around the topic of energy conservation which incorporates a variety of energy feedback visualizations, a multifaceted serious game with online educational activities, and real-world activities such as workshops and excursions. We describe our experiences in developing energy feedback visualizations in the Kukui Cup based on in-lab evaluations and field studies in college residence halls. We learned that energy feedback systems should address these factors: they should be actionable, that domain knowledge must go hand in hand with energy feedback systems, and that this feedback must be \`\`sticky'' to lead to changes in behaviors and attitudes.

                  knowledge. A high level of environmental literacy will be necessary to
                  navigate a future in which these skills are needed (King,
                  2000). Unfortunately, only 1-2 percent of American adults are considered
                  environmentally literate (Coyle, 2006).  Environmental education, the
                  key for producing environmentally literate citizens, has been on the
                  rise since it emerged in the 1970s. At the university level, the number
                  of sustainability programs and initiatives is inspiring (Shephard,
                  2006).  However, many of the changes in higher education have been on
                  physical campuses and not inside the classroom, and sustainability is
                  seen more as a prescriptive fix than a radical change in attitude,
                  concern, knowledge and behavior (Sherman, 2008; 2011).  A recent trend
                  on university campuses has been energy-saving competitions in university
                  buildings and on-campus dormitories — over 150 of these competitions
                  have taken place in the last few years, with median energy reductions of
                  22 percent (Johnson et al, 2011). This paper is a case study of one of
                  those competitions: the Kukui Cup at Hawai'i Pacific University
                  (HPU). In the three-weeklong competition, students living on campus
                  played an online game and participated in associated educational
                  activities using resources from the Collaborative Software Design
                  Laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. The Kukui Cup was an
                  attempt to use gamification techniques, competition and technology to
                  encourage changes in environmental behaviors, attitudes, concerns and
                  knowledge of oncampus residents, with hopes of improving their overall
                  levels of energy and environmental literacy. This study aims to answer
                  the questions: What is the level of environmental literacy of dorm
                  residents at HPU, and how is it affected by participation in an
                  on-campus energy-saving competition?  }

               this problem, I will work with the Makahiki development team to
               distribute surveys to identify usability issues.  For the first survey,
               University of Hawai‘i at M¯anoa students will configure Makahiki for a
               course assignment, self-report the time required for each part of the

               configuration times decreased and the usability issues of the original
               application were addressed by the redesign. The collection of usability
               data and the creation of the design tool will address Makahikis

This paper presents the Kukui Cup challenge, a multifaceted serious game designed around the topic of energy conservation that incorporates a variety of energy feedback visualizations, online educational activities, and real-world activities such as workshops and excursions. We describe our experiences developing energy feedback visualizations in the Kukui Cup based on in-lab evaluations and field studies in college residence halls. We learned that energy feedback systems should address these three factors: 1) they should be actionable, 2) domain knowledge should go hand in hand with feedback systems, and 3) feedback must be \`\`sticky'' if it is to lead to changes in behaviors and attitudes. We provide examples of both successful and unsuccessful visualizations, and discuss how they address the three factors we have identified.

Sustainability education and conservation have become an international imperative due to the rising cost of energy, increasing scarcity of natural resource and irresponsible environmental practices. Over the past decade, running energy and water challenges is the focal point for sustainability efforts at both university and industry campuses. Designers of such challenges typically have three choices for information technology: (a) build their own custom in-house solution; (b) out-source to a commercial provider; or (c) use a minimal tech solution such as a web page and manual posting of data and results.

None of these choices are ideal: the custom in-house solution requires sophisticated design and implementation skills; out-sourcing can be financially expensive and impedes evolution; and the minimal tech solution does not fully leverage the possibilities of advanced information technology.

To provide a better alternative to these three choices, I have led an effort over the past years to design and implement an open source serious game framework for sustainability called Makahiki. Makahiki implements an extensible framework with a variety of common services for developing sustainability games including authentication; game mechanics such as leaderboards, points, and badges; a variety of built-in games and content focused in sustainability, a responsive user interface, cloud-based deployment, and the ability to customize to the needs of individual organizations.

Makahiki lowers the overhead to those who would build a custom in-house solution by providing pre-built components. It can lower the financial cost to those who would out-source by providing an open source alternative. Finally, it provides an opportunity for those who would choose a minimal tech solution to instead provide more sophisticated information technology.

To provide initial evidence regarding the ability of the Makahiki framework to support sustainability games in different environments, we ran seven challenges at four  organizations: The University of Hawaii at Manoa, Hawaii Pacific University, the East-West Center and Holy Nativity School. While these experiences provided anecdotal evidence for the usefulness of Makahiki, we realized that a more rigorous evaluation of the framework would yield better quality insight into its current quality and requirements for future enhancement.

Upon review of the literature, we found little research or experience with formal serious game framework assessment. To address this, I have embarked on research to design an assessment mechanism for serious game frameworks, called Serious Game Stakeholder Experience Assessment Method (SGSEAM). SGSEAM is designed to provide detailed insight into the strengths and weaknesses of a serious game framework through a stakeholder perspective based approach. In my research, I applied SGSEAM to Makahiki in order to gain better insight into its strengths and weaknesses as a serious game framework.

The contributions of my research thus includes: the Makahiki as the serious game framework for sustainability; the SGSEAM assessment method; the insights into creating and running a variety of real-world serious games for sustainability in different organizations; the insights into managing cloud based serious games; and the insights into serious game framework design and assessment method generated through application of SGSEAM to Makahiki. I hope this research will be of interest to researchers and practitioners across several disciplines: software engineering, game design, and sustainability research.

While there has been a steady increase in sustainable HCI research, there remains a lack of consensus on how to ensure this research moves us towards achieving sustainability. This paper suggests three ways the sustainable HCI community might shift to better address the challenge of achieving global sustainability. First, we should shift from creating only small-scale solutions to systems and solutions that are scalable to many users and environments because the problem of sustainability is vast in scale. Second, we should shift from short-term solutions to \`sticky' solutions that will continue to have an impact over decades, because sustainability is a problem that will span generations. Third, the sustainable HCI community must shift from an insular focus on our community to a broad engagement and collaboration with other research communities involved in sustainability research.

system which has been designed to store, protect, and preserve digital records. The
types of digital records include medical records, annual reports, birth records, etc.
This records system requires a Digital Records Transfer tool which must provide government agencies of Hawaii with the ability to transfer digital records to the Hawaii

The usability of an application is a measure of how effectively it can be used to perform the tasks it was designed for in its target environment. A user interface – the toolbars, menus, and other elements that control an application – determines how quickly and correctly users can complete tasks. Makahiki is an application framework for designing serious games (games which teach a serious subject) focused on energy conservation, recycling, and clean energy issues. Two features were added to Makahiki in response to user feedback: support for a cross-platform installation method for virtual machines, and a simplified drag-and-drop graphical user interface called the Smart Grid Game Designer (SGG). Usability testing data and feedback on these new features was compared to data and feedback from the previous iteration of Makahiki to determine the effect of these features on the user experience. It was found that the virtual machine installation produced significant improvements in user experience and configuration time. However, users who tested the Smart Grid Game Designer reported issues in understanding Makahiki's "predicate system" of relationships between game tasks that were similar to issues reported by users of the previous iteration of Makahiki.

In the past 10 years, there has been considerable evidence of the harmful effects of multitasking and other distractions on learning. One study found that multitasking students spend only 65 percent of their time actively learning, take longer to complete assignments, make more mistakes, are less able to remember material later, and show less ability to generalize the information they learned for use in other contexts.

Traditional software engineering education approaches: in-class lectures, unsupervised homework assignments, and occasional projects, create many opportunities for distraction. To address this problem, coauthor Philip M. Johnson developed an “athletic” software engineering education approach, which coauthors Emily Hill and Daniel Port adapted for use in their courses. We wanted to determine if software engineering education could be redesigned to be like an athletic endeavor and whether this would improve learning.

We present our findings after two years of experience involving three instructors using an “athletic” approach to software engineering education (AthSE). Co-author Johnson developed AthSE in 2013 to address issues he experienced teaching graduate and undergraduate software engineering. Co-authors Port and Hill subsequently adapted the original approach to their own software courses. AthSE is a pedagogy in which the course is organized into a series of skills to be mastered. For each skill, students are given practice "Workouts" along with videos showing the instructor performing the Workout both correctly and quickly. Unlike traditional homework assignments, students are advised to repeat the Workout not only until they can complete it correctly, but also as quickly as the instructor. In this experience report we investigate the following question: how can software engineering education be redesigned as an athletic endeavor, and will this provide more efficient and effective learning among students and more rapidly lead them to greater competency and confidence?

The transmissions released by these tags carry serial identification numbers that can be used to verify that a particular individual was near a given receiver. Because receivers in these networks are stationary, receiver placement is critical to maximizing data recovery. Currently, no open-source automated mechanism exists to facilitate the design of optimal receiver networks. SON design is often governed by loose "rules of thumb" and "by eye" readings of low resolution bathymetric maps. Moreover, there is no standardized method for evaluating the efficacy of a SON. This paper introduces the Maximal Acoustic Network Designer (MANDe) a system which takes advantage of high-resolution bathymetric data and advanced animal modeling to provide optimal network designs. MANDe also allows for statistical analysis of existing network configurations in order to create efficacy-metrics that can be used to evaluate arbitrary network configurations. This paper will present MANDe’s mathematical and conceptual models and analyze the computational complexities of its methods. }

  abstract = {Capturing and classifying power quality phenomena is important for the smooth functioning of electrical grids.  This paper presents methods for classifying the four types of transients (impulsive, arcing, oscillatory, and periodic notching) specified in the IEEE 1159 Power Quality standard. Our methods implement a tractable algorithm, which applies well understood signal processing methods and statistical inference for feature extraction and decision making. We tested our methods on simulated power quality disturbances in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. The results of this research include an operational implementation of a transient classifier for Open Power Quality, an open source distributed power quality network. Additional functionality can be easily incorporated into the system to extend the utility of our methods, such as a meta-analysis to capture higher level network wide events.

Modern web application development provides an attractive application area for introductory software engineering education, as students have direct experience with the domain and it provides them with the potential to gain practical, real-world skills. Achieving this potential requires the development of competency with a multiple component tech stack for web application development, which is challenging to acquire within a single semester. In this research, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a new pedagogy called “athletic software engineering” which is intended to help students efficiently and effectively acquire competency with a multiple component tech stack as a precursor to a web application development project. We evaluated the pedagogy over 4 years and six semesters with 286 students and found strong evidence for its effectiveness.

RadGrad is a curriculum initiative implemented via a web-based application that combines features of social networks, degree planners, and serious games. RadGrad redefines the traditional meaning of \`\`progress'' and \`\`success'' in the undergraduate computer science degree program, with the ultimate goal of improving student engagement, diversity, and retention.  In this paper, we relate RadGrad to other curriculum initiatives, overview its key functionality, present results from an evaluation conducted during its first year of deployment, and discuss our lessons learned and future directions.

Distributed Sensor Networks (DSNs) face a myriad of technical challenges. This dissertation examines two important DSN challenges.

 One problem is converting \`\`primitive" sensor data into actionable products and insights. For example, a DSN for power quality (PQ) might gather primitive data in the form of raw voltage waveforms and produce actionable insights in the form of the ability to predict when PQ events are going to occur by observing cyclical data. For another example, a DSN for infrasound might gather primitive data in the form of microphone counts and produce actionable insight in the form of determining what, when, and where the signal came from. To make progress towards this problem, DSNs typically implement one or more of the following strategies: detecting signals in the primitive data (deciding if something is there), classification of signals from primitive data (deciding what is there), and localization of signals (when and from where did the signals come). Further, DSNs make progress towards this problem by forming relationships between primitive data by finding correlations between spatial attributes, temporal attributes, and by associating metadata with primitive data to provide contextual information not collected by the DSN. These strategies can be employed recursively. As an example, the result of aggregating typed primitive data provides a new higher level of typed data which contains more context than the data from which is was derived from. This new typed data can itself be aggregated into new, higher level types and also participate in relationships.

 A second important challenge is managing data volume. Most DSNs produce large amounts of (increasingly multimodal) primitive data, of which only a tiny fraction (the signals) is actually interesting and useful. The DSN can utilize one of two strategies: keep all of the information and primitive data forever, or employ some sort of strategy for systematically discarding (hopefully uninteresting and not useful) data. As sensor networks scale in size, the first strategy becomes unfeasible. Therefore, DSNs must find and implement a strategy for managing large amounts of sensor data. The difficult part is finding an effective and efficient strategy deciding what data is interesting and must be kept and what data to discard.

 This dissertation investigates the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Laha framework, which provides new insight into both of these problems. First, the Laha framework provides a multi-leveled representation for structuring and processing DSN data. The structure and processing at each level is designed with the explicit goal of turning low-level data into actionable insights. Second, each level in the framework implements a \`\`time-to-live" (TTL) strategy for data within the level. This strategy states that data must either \`\`progress" upwards through the levels towards more abstract, useful representations within a fixed time window, or be discarded and lost forever. The TTL strategy is useful because when implemented, it allows DSN designers to calculate upper bounds on data storage at each level of the framework and supports graceful degradation of DSN performance.

 There are several smaller, but still important problems that exist within the context of these two larger problems. Examples of the smaller problems that Laha hopes to overcome in transit to the larger goals include optimization of triggering, detection, and classification, building a model of sensing field topology, optimizing sensor energy use, optimizing bandwidth, and providing predictive analytics for DSNs.

 Laha provides four contributions to the area of DSNs. First, the Laha design, a novel abstract distributed sensor network that provides useful properties relating to data management. Second, an evaluation of the Laha abstract framework through the deployment of two Laha-compliant reference implementations, validated data collection, and several experiments that are used to either confirm or deny the benefits touted by Laha. Third, two Laha-compliant reference implementations, OPQ and Lokahi, which can be used to form DSNs for the collection of distributed power quality signals and the distributed collection of infrasound signals. Fourth, a set of implications for modern distributed sensor networks as a result of the evaluation of Laha.

 The major claim of this dissertation is that the Laha Framework provides a generally useful representation for real-time high-volume DSNs that address several major issues that modern DSNs face.

Today's big data world heavily relies upon providing precise, timely, and actionable intelligence, while being burdened by the ever increasing need for data cleaning and preprocessing.
While in the case of ingesting large quantity of unstructured data this problem is unavoidable, when it comes to sensor networks built for a specific purpose, such as anomaly detection, some of that computation can be moved to the edge of the network.
This thesis concerns the special case of sensor networks tailored for monitoring the power grid for anomalous behavior.
These networks monitor power delivery infrastructure with the intent of finding deviations from the nominal steady state, across multiple geographical locations.
Aforementioned deviations, known as power quality anomalies, may originate, and be localized to the location of the sensor, or may affect a sizable portion of the power grid.
The difficulty of evaluating the extent of a power quality anomaly stems directly from their short temporal and variable geographical impact.
I present a novel distributed power quality monitoring system called Napali which relies on extracted metrics from individual meters and their temporal locality in order to intelligently detect anomalies and extract raw data within temporal window and geographical areas of interest.

The claims of this thesis are that Napali outperforms existing power quality monitoring gridwide event detection methods in resource utilization and sensitivity.
Furthermore, Napali residential monitoring is capable of power grid monitoring without deployment on the high voltage transmission lines.
Final claim of this thesis is that Napali capability of extracting portions of the events which did not pass the critical thresholds used in other detection methods allows for better localization of power quality disturbances.
Napali claim validation was performed through deployment at the University of Hawaii.
Fifteen OPQ Box devices, designed specifically to operate with Napali were located in various locations on campus.
Data collected from these monitors was compared with smart meters already deployed across the University.
Additionally, Napali was compared with standard methods of power quality event detection running along side the Napali systems.

Napali methodology outperformed the standard methods of power quality monitoring in resource consumption, event quality and sensitivity.
Additionally, I was able to validate that residential utility monitoring is capable of event detection and localization without monitoring higher levels of the power grid hierarchy.
Finally, as a demonstration of Napali capabilities, I showed how data collected by my framework can be used to partition the power delivery infrastructure without prior knowledge of the power grid topology.
