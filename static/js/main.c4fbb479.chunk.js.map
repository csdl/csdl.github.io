The combination of the representation and related computational services should actually lead to improved performance by learners on selected collaborative learning tasks.\n\nKnowledge representation is not only fundamental to machine learning, but is also essential to human learning. However, few existing learning support systems provide representations which help the learner make sense of and organize the subject content of learning, integrate a wide range of classroom activities, and compare and contrast various viewpoints from individual learners.\n\nCLARE is an Egret-based system designed to investigate issues in computer-mediated collaborative learning. This system provides a data and process model implementing a novel meta-cognitive framework for knowledge construction. CLARE facilitates seminar-style environments for review and critique of scientific literature.\n\nWe believe that collaborative learning is an active knowledge construction process and assert that knowledge representation plays an essential role in achieving a high level of collaborative support. Our approach involves the definition of a representational framework, called RESRA, which characterizes the thematic structure of learning and research artifacts. We then developed a computer-based tool, CLARE, that facilitates the use of RESRA for various collaborative learning tasks. Finally, we employed a case study to empirically assess the effectiveness of CLARE and these research claims.\n\nCLARE was evaluated through a case study with sixteen usage sessions involving six groups of students from two classes. The case study included a total of about 300 hours of usage and over 80,000 timestamps.\n\nA survey of CLARE’s sessions shows that about 70% of learners think that CLARE provides a novel way of understanding scientific text, and about 80% of learners think that CLARE provides a novel way of understanding their peers’ perspectives. The analysis of the CLARE database also reveals that learners differ greatly in their interpretations of RESRA, strategies for comprehending the online text, and understanding of the selected artifact. We also found that, despite the large amount of time spent on summarization, up to 66% of these learners often fail to correctly represent important features of scientific text and the relationships between those features.\n`,\n    },\n    {\n      date: '1993 - 1994',\n      project: 'URN',\n      keyword: 'URN',\n      text: 'Explore representations and processes needed to model user interests and predict relevency of usenet postings.',\n      media: 'images/urn-small.png',\n      bigImage: '',\n      longText: `\nURN was an Egret-based system designed to address the “information explosion” that occurs through use of world-wide information resources such as the Internet USENET newsgroups, gopher, and so forth. The problems in filtering relevant and useful knowledge from the avalanche of unrelated, low quality, or outdated information posted and accessible is well-known.\n\nURN attempted to exploit collaboration among people with similar interests to support incremental restructuring, classification, and filtering of these information sources. A prototype collaborative newsreader has been implemented and evaluated to test these mechanisms.\n\nEffective utilization of Usenet can be improved through explicitly collaborative efforts among small groups of people with similar interests who work together to retrieve, filter, and ultimately restructure information produced by Usenet into a form amenable to their own needs.\n\nURN was designed to explore the representations and processes needed to provide a model of the interests of individuals within the group that can be used to predict the relevancy of future Usenet contributions. URN users collaboratively and incrementally create a shared, global representation of the content of each Usenet posting, but individually assess its relevancy to their own personal interests.

AEN research was intended to provide insight into the process and tool support required for the development of high quality, jointly-authored hypertext documents.\n\nWith the advent of the World Wide Web, the use of hypertext as a structuring mechanism for richly interdependent information has become ubiquitous. With its rich mechanisms for distribution, the web also allows authors to collaboratively build work products by weaving together smaller sections into an interlinked whole. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the process of such “collaborative hypertext construction”, and current authoring support consists of little more than traditional configuration control mechanisms. Without an understanding of the appropriate way to collaboratively construct hypertext documents and without appropriate tool support, such jointly authored work products can suffer from quality problems ranging from inconsistency to incompleteness to even incoherency.\n\nAEN research is based upon the notion of a continuum of collaboration, ranging from “weak” collaboration to “strong” collaboration. In strong collaboration, each participant contributes to the construction of every component of the document, and gains new knowledge as a direct result of this construction. The constructed document is not simply a patchwork of individual contributions, but instead, an incremental, emergent synthesis that reflects the knowledge created by the group as a whole. Strong collaboration is the antithesis of a ‘divide and conquer’ approach, whereby the work product is simply sliced up into components, each of which is then developed independently and exclusively by a single author. We call this divide and conquer approach “weak” collaboration.\n\nThe AEN system provides tools designed to support a strongly collaborative approach to hypertext document construction. These tools include an access control mechanism, a feedback tool, a dynamic table of contents, a tool for representing virtual presence within the document, and an on-line chat facility.\n\nTo evaluate AEN, we performed a case study involving 15 students divided into three software teams who developed a software requirements specification hypertext document over the course of a semester. We hypothesized that use of AEN would lead to the presence of strongly collaborative practice among some of the groups.\n\nDuring the case study, the three groups spent over 180 hours using AEN. They created 100 document nodes, 111 comment nodes, and 5 figure nodes. You can see an HTML version of the AEN database as it was on 12/13/94, although this representation loses much of the richness of the AEN environment.\n\nTo evaluate our hypothesis concerning strong collaboration, we devised five metrics for collaboration:\n\n  * Readers per node (RPN) Measures the average number of readers per node for a group.\n  * Editors per node (EPN) Measures the average number of editors per node for a group.\n  * Feedback node creation (FNC) Measures the percentage of document nodes containing a link to a comment node.\n  * Non-default access control (NAC) Measures the percentage of nodes whose access control has been changed from the default (which is no access for other members.)\n  * Evolving Access Control (EAC) Measures the percentage of document nodes that have had their access control changed more than once.\n\nHigh values for all of these metrics indicate the presence of strong collaboration, while uniformly low values indicate a divide and conquer approach, or weak collaboration. Our results indicate that strong collaboration was present to some extent in all the groups.\n`,\n    },\n    {\n      date: '1991 - 1996',\n      project: 'CSRS',\n      keyword: 'CSRS',\n      text: 'The Computer Supported Review System enables declarative definition of review processes and instrumentation for data collection.',\n      media: 'images/csrs-small.png',\n      bigImage: 'images/csrs-big.gif',\n      longText: `\nCSRS was a computer-supported software review system that enabled declarative definition of review processes and provides instrumented data collection facilities.\n\nFormal technical review (FTR) is a cornerstone of software quality assurance.

The design, implementation, and evaluation of a computer-supported software review system (CSRS) that enables declarative definition of review processes and provides instrumented facilities for gathering and analyzing review data.

Flashmail, to our knowledge, was the earliest implementation of an “instant messaging system”.\n\nAlthough e-mail has many strengths as a computer-mediated communication (CMC) tool, it also has weaknesses. One problem with e-mail is lack of support for time-dependent messages—messages whose usefulness expires after a short period of time when they are not read. For example, say that you want to hold a meeting with colleagues in one hour. You can send them e-mail, but you have no guarantee that everyone will read their e-mail within the hour. Furthermore, if one of the recipients does not read their mail before the meeting time, the message no longer serves any purpose and simply clutters up their mailbox.\n\nFlashmail is an Egret-based tool that transfers messages between a small, pre-selected group of people, and can virtually guarantee that a message sent to group members will be seen immediately in certain situations. It consists of two basic capabilities: a menu-based mechanism that shows whether members of the group are actively using their workstation, and a message facility that pops up a window on their workstation screen with a message.\n\nFlashmail was evaluated via a case study designed to test the conditions under which user would choose Flashmail or traditional email for communication.

JWiz is a source code analysis tool which searches for certain types of run-time programming errors (such as the use of “==” rather than the “equals” method to compare two strings). Over 50 kinds of Java programming errors are searched for using this tool.\n\nWe performed a case study over a period of four weeks, where several student programming projects were analyzed for the occurrence of programming errors of the kind searched for by JavaWiz. The case study was designed to assess whether JavaWiz was useful for detection of Java programming errors, and whether the kinds of errors found appear to suggest useful improvements to the language. Programmers submitted their program after the first clean compile, but before performing any testing. We analyzed these programs using JWiz. After the programmers completed debugging the program (and recording the time spent removing each defect), we gave them the results of the JWiz analysis and asked them which errors they had found during their debugging and how long it took them to remove the errors.\n\nWe collected data from 14 students over three programming projects which produced approximately 12,800 lines of code. JavaWiz raised 267 warnings on this code. We classified each warning as one of the following:\n\n  * Functional errors, where the warning must be fixed for the program to work properly.\n  * Maintenance errors, where the warning need not be fixed, but the code would be considered to be bad style.\n  * False positives, where the warning was produced by code that was properly implemented, according to the developer.\n\nOut of 267 JWiz warnings, there were 79 functional errors, 110 maintenance errors, and 78 false positives. In the case of functional errors, we were able to collect data on the time spent by programmers to detect the errors that JWiz found automatically.

The Personal Software Process (PSP) is used by software engineers to gather and analyze data about their work, and to produce empirically based evidence for the improvement of planning and quality in future projects. Published studies have suggested that adopting the PSP results in improved size and time estimation and in reduced numbers of defects found in the compile and test phases of development. However, the results of most studies evaluating the PSP are based on analysis of PSP data – data of unknown accuracy.\n\nThere are two basic phases when using the PSP: collection and analysis. In the collection phase a software engineer does actual work, and records primary measures about the work such as time and defect data. In the analysis phase this data is analyzed to provide derived measures such as lines of code per hour or the percentage of defects removed before the first compile. One goal of this research was to learn what kind of errors are made in the analysis phase and to see if there is any evidence of problems in the collection phase. This information provides some idea of the overall quality of PSP data. A second goal was to determine the impact of errors made on commonly used PSP measures such as yield and cost performance index.\n\nIn the Fall of 1996 a one-semester software engineering class was taught, covering the PSP. Because of prior concerns about data quality, many steps were taken to address this issue; including curriculum modifications, in-class technical review, and special forms. Using the PSP, 89 projects were completed by 10 students. Then, two database systems were built using Progress 4GL/RDBMS. The first was designed to automate the PSP as far as possible through the process level PSP2. The second was designed to record errors found in PSP data. The class projects were entered into the automated PSP system. Any discrepancies between the paper forms and values generated by the automated system were recorded using the error recording tool. Then all errors collected were analyzed by type, subtype, severity, age, etc. Finally, an attempt was made to correct the students’ PSP data as far as possible. The original and corrected values were compared.\n\n1539 errors were found, mostly analysis errors. 34% were of the most severe type – errors that resulted in multiple bad values on multiple forms for multiple projects. There was also evidence of problems in the collection phase, with 90 errors resulting from conflicts within or between time and defect data. Correction of the data showed that the student errors had a substantial impact on important measures such as yield and cost performance index.\n`,\n    },\n    {\n      date: '1997 - 2000',\n      project: 'LEAP',\n      keyword: 'Leap',\n      text: 'Lightweight, empirical, automated, and portable tools and techniques to support individual software process improvement.',\n      media: 'images/leap-small.png',\n      bigImage: 'images/leap-big.gif',\n      longText: `\nProject LEAP was designed to investigate the following problems in software process improvement initiatives:\n\n  * Heavyweight development process constraints.

LEAP support must be “light-weight”. It must be easy to learn, easy to integrate with existing methods and tools, and above all, not impose significant new overhead on the developer unless that investment of overhead will provide a direct return-on-investment to that same developer.\n  * Empirical. LEAP support should be quantitative as well as qualitative. Software developer improvement should be able to be shown through measurements of effort, defects, size, and so forth.\n  * Automated. Light-weight support for empirically-based developer improvement virtually demands some form of automation. On the other hand, automation does not by itself guarantee light-weight processes or meaningful empirical evidence of improvement.\n  * Portable. As a developer-oriented approach, Project LEAP recognizes that any long-term improvement mechanism must accommodate the fact that software developers change jobs and companies on a regular basis. Useful support cannot be locked into a particular organization such that the developer must “give up” the data and tools when they leave the organization. Rather, LEAP support will be a kind of “personal information assistant” for their software engineering skill set.\n\nTo investigate some of the issues of data collection and analysis, we conducted a case study of 16 graduate students in an advanced software engineering course at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.

We hypothesize that the inspection of MINI documents will generate more defects with a higher severity than inspecting LINI documents.\n\nEvaluation of the Priority Ranked Inspection method involved a simple exploratory study, which included inspecting MINI and LINI software code and checking to see if MINI code inspections generate more defects than LINI code inspections. The results of the study provide supporting evidence that MINI documents do contain more high-severity defects than LINI documents. In addition, there is some evidence that PRI can provide developers with more information to help determine what documents they should select for inspection.\n`,\n    },\n    {\n      date: '2005 - 2006',\n      project: 'Continuous GQM',\n      keyword: 'C-GQM',\n      text: 'Integrate Hackystat real-time measurement with Goal-Question-Metric analysis.',\n      media: 'images/continuous-gqm-small.png',\n      bigImage: '',\n      longText: `\nThis research investigated the integration of Hackystat metrics collection with the GQM (Goal / Question / Metric) Analysis Paradigm.

During the course of this work, an extension to Hackystat called hackyCGQM was implemented. As a result, hackyCGQM enables Hackystat to be used as a Software Project Control Center (SPCC) by providing purposeful high-level representations of the measurement data.\n\nAnother interesting side-effect of the combination of Hackystat and hackyCGQM is that this system is able to perform fully automated measurement and analysis cycles. This leads to the development of cGQM, a specialized method for fully automated, GQM based measurement programs.  As a result, hackyCGQM is able to implement a completely automated GQM-based measurement framework. This high degree of automation is made possible by limiting the implemented measurement programs to metrics which can be measured automatically, thus sacrificing the ability to use arbitrary metrics.\n`,\n    },\n    {\n      date: '2002 - 2006',\n      project: 'JBlanket',\n      keyword: 'JBlanket',\n      text: 'A new technique called \"Extreme Coverage\" for measuring test quality.',\n      media: 'images/jblanket-small.png',\n      bigImage: 'images/jblanket-big.gif',\n      longText: `\nThe JBlanket project investigated a set of guidelines called “extreme coverage” for measuring the quality of unit tests independent of the phase of software development.

These variations in levels can lead to obscure pieces of crucial code being overlooked during testing.\n\nThe JBlanket system was implemented in the first half of the Fall 2002 semester and evaluated in an undergraduate second semester Software Engineering course.

Instead, most organizations simply use paper or text editors to support their code review processes.
