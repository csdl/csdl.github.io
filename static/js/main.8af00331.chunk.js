literature that also supports useful computational manipulations. The combination of the representation and related computational services should actually lead to improved performance by learners on selected collaborative learning tasks.\n\nKnowledge representation is not only fundamental to machine learning, but is also essential to human learning. However, few existing learning support systems provide representations which help the learner make sense of and organize the subject content of learning, integrate a wide range of classroom activities, and compare and contrast various viewpoints from individual learners.\n\nCLARE is an Egret-based system designed to investigate issues in computer-mediated collaborative learning. This system provides a data and process model implementing a novel meta-cognitive framework for knowledge construction. CLARE facilitates seminar-style environments for review and critique of scientific literature.\n\nWe believe that collaborative learning is an active knowledge construction process and assert that knowledge representation plays an essential role in achieving a high level of collaborative support. Our approach involves the definition of a representational framework, called RESRA, which characterizes the thematic structure of learning and research artifacts. We then developed a computer-based tool, CLARE, that facilitates the use of RESRA for various collaborative learning tasks. Finally, we employed a case study to empirically assess the effectiveness of CLARE and these research claims.\n\nCLARE was evaluated through a case study with sixteen usage sessions involving six groups of students from two classes. The case study included a total of about 300 hours of usage and over 80,000 timestamps.\n\nA survey of CLARE\u2019s sessions shows that about 70% of learners think that CLARE provides a novel way of understanding scientific text, and about 80% of learners think that CLARE provides a novel way of understanding their peers\u2019 perspectives. The analysis of the CLARE database also reveals that learners differ greatly in their interpretations of RESRA, strategies for comprehending the online text, and understanding of the selected artifact. We also found that, despite the large amount of time spent on summarization, up to 66% of these learners often fail to correctly represent important features of scientific text and the relationships between those features.\n"},{date:"1993 - 1994",project:"URN",text:"Explore representations and processes needed to model user interests and predict relevency of usenet postings.",url:"",media:"images/urn-small.png",bigImage:"",longText:"\nURN was an Egret-based system designed to address the \u201cinformation explosion\u201d that occurs through use of world-wide information resources such as the Internet USENET newsgroups, gopher, and so forth. The problems in filtering relevant and useful knowledge from the avalanche of unrelated, low quality, or outdated information posted and accessible is well-known.\n\nURN attempted to exploit collaboration among people with similar interests to support incremental restructuring, classification, and filtering of these information sources. A prototype collaborative newsreader has been implemented and evaluated to test these mechanisms.\n\nEffective utilization of Usenet can be improved through explicitly collaborative efforts among small groups of people with similar interests who work together to retrieve, filter, and ultimately restructure information produced by Usenet into a form amenable to their own needs.\n\nURN was designed to explore the representations and processes needed to provide a model of the interests of individuals within the group that can be used to predict the relevancy of future Usenet contributions. URN users collaboratively and incrementally create a shared, global representation of the content of each Usenet posting, but individually assess its relevancy to their own personal interests. The collaboration minimizes the overhead to any individual of this annotation, while improving the quality of the data used for relevancy assessment.\n\nSignificantly, URN did not require users to agree upon a common single measure of relevancy \u2013 URN maintains a separate model of each user\u2019s interests. Instead, URN users focus their collaborative efforts on building a shared representation of each article\u2019s content and structure.\n\nURN was evaluated internally by members of CSDL through a case study involving newsgroup reading. Metrics were collected on user voting behavior in order to show that URN improves the Usenet reading experience.\n"},{date:"1994 - 1995",project:"AEN",text:"Process and tool support for the development of high quality, jointly-authored hypertext documents.",url:"",media:"images/aen-small.png",bigImage:"images/aen-big.png",longText:"\nThe goal of AEN research was to develop a better understanding of the nature of collaborative hypertext authoring. AEN research was intended to provide insight into the process and tool support required for the development of high quality, jointly-authored hypertext documents.\n\nWith the advent of the World Wide Web, the use of hypertext as a structuring mechanism for richly interdependent information has become ubiquitous. With its rich mechanisms for distribution, the web also allows authors to collaboratively build work products by weaving together smaller sections into an interlinked whole. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the process of such \u201ccollaborative hypertext construction\u201d, and current authoring support consists of little more than traditional configuration control mechanisms. Without an understanding of the appropriate way to collaboratively construct hypertext documents and without appropriate tool support, such jointly authored work products can suffer from quality problems ranging from inconsistency to incompleteness to even incoherency.\n\nAEN research is based upon the notion of a continuum of collaboration, ranging from \u201cweak\u201d collaboration to \u201cstrong\u201d collaboration. In strong collaboration, each participant contributes to the construction of every component of the document, and gains new knowledge as a direct result of this construction. The constructed document is not simply a patchwork of individual contributions, but instead, an incremental, emergent synthesis that reflects the knowledge created by the group as a whole. Strong collaboration is the antithesis of a \u2018divide and conquer\u2019 approach, whereby the work product is simply sliced up into components, each of which is then developed independently and exclusively by a single author. We call this divide and conquer approach \u201cweak\u201d collaboration.\n\nThe AEN system provides tools designed to support a strongly collaborative approach to hypertext document construction. These tools include an access control mechanism, a feedback tool, a dynamic table of contents, a tool for representing virtual presence within the document, and an on-line chat facility.\n\nTo evaluate AEN, we performed a case study involving 15 students divided into three software teams who developed a software requirements specification hypertext document over the course of a semester. We hypothesized that use of AEN would lead to the presence of strongly collaborative practice among some of the groups.\n\nDuring the case study, the three groups spent over 180 hours using AEN. They created 100 document nodes, 111 comment nodes, and 5 figure nodes. You can see an HTML version of the AEN database as it was on 12/13/94, although this representation loses much of the richness of the AEN environment.\n\nTo evaluate our hypothesis concerning strong collaboration, we devised five metrics for collaboration:\n\n  * Readers per node (RPN) Measures the average number of readers per node for a group.\n  * Editors per node (EPN) Measures the average number of editors per node for a group.\n  * Feedback node creation (FNC) Measures the percentage of document nodes containing a link to a comment node.\n  * Non-default access control (NAC) Measures the percentage of nodes whose access control has been changed from the default (which is no access for other members.)\n  * Evolving Access Control (EAC) Measures the percentage of document nodes that have had their access control changed more than once.\n\nHigh values for all of these metrics indicate the presence of strong collaboration, while uniformly low values indicate a divide and conquer approach, or weak collaboration. Our results indicate that strong collaboration was present to some extent in all the groups.\n"},{date:"1991 - 1996",project:"CSRS",text:"The Computer Supported Review System enables declarative definition of review processes and instrumentation for data collection.",url:"",media:"images/csrs-small.png",bigImage:"images/csrs-big.gif",longText:"\nCSRS was a computer-supported software review system that enabled declarative definition of review processes and provides instrumented data collection facilities.\n\nFormal technical review (FTR) is a cornerstone of software quality assurance. However, the labor-intensive and manual nature of review, along with basic unresolved questions about its process and products, means that review is typically under-utilized or inefficiently applied within the software development process.\n\nThere were two primary goals for the CSRS research project:\n\n  1. The design, implementation, and evaluation of a computer-supported software review system (CSRS) that enables declarative definition of review processes and provides instrumented facilities for gathering and analyzing review data. For this goal, our approach has been to incrementally design and evaluate the CSRS system over a period of several years, along with public release of the system for use by other research and industry sites.\n  2. The use of CSRS as a laboratory testbed for studying differences between review methods under highly controlled conditions. For this goal, we have carried out one controlled experimental study thus far, involving a comparison of review methods designed to assess the impact of the review meeting on review cost and effectiveness. We further extended this research with a comparative analysis of this study with a similar study performed by Adam Porter at the University of Maryland. See the Research References section below for details.\n\nOur results indicate that CSRS increases both the breadth and depth of information captured per person-hour of review time, and that its design captures interesting measures of review process, products, and effort.\n\nOur study of review meetings found that meetings do not significantly increase defect detection effectiveness, but do increase overall review costs. Interestingly, our study also found that the student population studied greatly preferred the meeting-based method over the non-meeting-based method, and believed that the meeting-based method led to higher review quality, even though there was no empirical evidence to support this opinion!\n"},{date:"1995 - 1996",project:"Flashmail",text:'Investigate time-dependent electronic messages.

Flashmail, to our knowledge, was the earliest implementation of an \u201cinstant messaging system\u201d.\n\nAlthough e-mail has many strengths as a computer-mediated communication (CMC) tool, it also has weaknesses. One problem with e-mail is lack of support for time-dependent messages\u2014messages whose usefulness expires after a short period of time when they are not read. For example, say that you want to hold a meeting with colleagues in one hour. You can send them e-mail, but you have no guarantee that everyone will read their e-mail within the hour. Furthermore, if one of the recipients does not read their mail before the meeting time, the message no longer serves any purpose and simply clutters up their mailbox.\n\nFlashmail is an Egret-based tool that transfers messages between a small, pre-selected group of people, and can virtually guarantee that a message sent to group members will be seen immediately in certain situations. It consists of two basic capabilities: a menu-based mechanism that shows whether members of the group are actively using their workstation, and a message facility that pops up a window on their workstation screen with a message.\n\nFlashmail was evaluated via a case study designed to test the conditions under which user would choose Flashmail or traditional email for communication. Data collection occurred from March 11 through April 15, 1996, and the participants were the members of the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory (CSDL).\n\nWe collected data on hundreds of email and Flashmail messages during the study period.

Better understanding of Java programming errors could lead to improvements in Java software quality in a number of ways, such as:\n\n  * Redesign to prevent/reduce the occurrence of errors due to poor class library design;\n  * Targeting problematic idioms or domains where increased education and emphasis is necessary.\n  * Automated tool support for error detection.\n\nOur approach involves the development and use of a software tool named JavaWizard (or JWiz). JWiz is a source code analysis tool which searches for certain types of run-time programming errors (such as the use of \u201c==\u201d rather than the \u201cequals\u201d method to compare two strings). Over 50 kinds of Java programming errors are searched for using this tool.\n\nWe performed a case study over a period of four weeks, where several student programming projects were analyzed for the occurrence of programming errors of the kind searched for by JavaWiz. The case study was designed to assess whether JavaWiz was useful for detection of Java programming errors, and whether the kinds of errors found appear to suggest useful improvements to the language. Programmers submitted their program after the first clean compile, but before performing any testing. We analyzed these programs using JWiz. After the programmers completed debugging the program (and recording the time spent removing each defect), we gave them the results of the JWiz analysis and asked them which errors they had found during their debugging and how long it took them to remove the errors.\n\nWe collected data from 14 students over three programming projects which produced approximately 12,800 lines of code. JavaWiz raised 267 warnings on this code. We classified each warning as one of the following:\n\n  * Functional errors, where the warning must be fixed for the program to work properly.\n  * Maintenance errors, where the warning need not be fixed, but the code would be considered to be bad style.\n  * False positives, where the warning was produced by code that was properly implemented, according to the developer.\n\nOut of 267 JWiz warnings, there were 79 functional errors, 110 maintenance errors, and 78 false positives. In the case of functional errors, we were able to collect data on the time spent by programmers to detect the errors that JWiz found automatically. This data shows that JavaWizard could have eliminated a total of five and a half hours, or 7.3 percent of the total time spent debugging in the test phase.\n"},{date:"1996 - 1999",project:"PSP Data Quality",text:"Experimental findings from Personal Software Process usage reveals significant errors due to manual data collection and analysis.",url:"",media:"images/psp-data-quality-small.png",bigImage:"",longText:"\nThis research investigated how natural human error during data collection and analysis impacts on PSP analysis results. The Personal Software Process (PSP) is used by software engineers to gather and analyze data about their work, and to produce empirically based evidence for the improvement of planning and quality in future projects. Published studies have suggested that adopting the PSP results in improved size and time estimation and in reduced numbers of defects found in the compile and test phases of development. However, the results of most studies evaluating the PSP are based on analysis of PSP data \u2013 data of unknown accuracy.\n\nThere are two basic phases when using the PSP: collection and analysis. In the collection phase a software engineer does actual work, and records primary measures about the work such as time and defect data. In the analysis phase this data is analyzed to provide derived measures such as lines of code per hour or the percentage of defects removed before the first compile. One goal of this research was to learn what kind of errors are made in the analysis phase and to see if there is any evidence of problems in the collection phase. This information provides some idea of the overall quality of PSP data. A second goal was to determine the impact of errors made on commonly used PSP measures such as yield and cost performance index.\n\nIn the Fall of 1996 a one-semester software engineering class was taught, covering the PSP. Because of prior concerns about data quality, many steps were taken to address this issue; including curriculum modifications, in-class technical review, and special forms. Using the PSP, 89 projects were completed by 10 students. Then, two database systems were built using Progress 4GL/RDBMS. The first was designed to automate the PSP as far as possible through the process level PSP2. The second was designed to record errors found in PSP data. The class projects were entered into the automated PSP system. Any discrepancies between the paper forms and values generated by the automated system were recorded using the error recording tool. Then all errors collected were analyzed by type, subtype, severity, age, etc. Finally, an attempt was made to correct the students\u2019 PSP data as far as possible. The original and corrected values were compared.\n\n1539 errors were found, mostly analysis errors. 34% were of the most severe type \u2013 errors that resulted in multiple bad values on multiple forms for multiple projects. There was also evidence of problems in the collection phase, with 90 errors resulting from conflicts within or between time and defect data. Correction of the data showed that the student errors had a substantial impact on important measures such as yield and cost performance index.\n"},{date:"1997 - 2000",project:"LEAP",text:"Lightweight, empirical, automated, and portable tools and techniques to support individual software process improvement.",url:"",media:"images/leap-small.png",bigImage:"images/leap-big.gif",longText:"\nProject LEAP was designed to investigate the following problems in software process improvement initiatives:\n\n  * Heavyweight development process constraints.

LEAP support should be quantitative as well as qualitative. Software developer improvement should be able to be shown through measurements of effort, defects, size, and so forth.\n  * Automated. Light-weight support for empirically-based developer improvement virtually demands some form of automation. On the other hand, automation does not by itself guarantee light-weight processes or meaningful empirical evidence of improvement.\n  * Portable.

Useful support cannot be locked into a particular organization such that the developer must \u201cgive up\u201d the data and tools when they leave the organization.

By taking into account domain-specific aspects of the mailing list, searching can be improved even more.\n\nElectronic mailing lists are popular Internet information sources. Many mailing lists maintain an archive of all messages sent to the list which is often searchable using keywords.

Zorro works by analyzing process data gathered by a Hackystat sensor attached to an interactive development environment such as Eclipse. Examples of such process data includes the editing of a a test case, the compilation and building of the software, the running of a test case, and so forth.\n\nZorro implemented a set of rules that first partitions the stream of observed developer behaviors gathered by the sensor into a sequence of \u201cepisodes\u201d, each of which may or may not correspond to a TDD cycle. A second set of rules are then applied to each episode in order to classify it as an instance of TDD or not. A pilot validation study conducted in the Spring of 2006 indicated that Zorro recognized episodes of TDD with almost 90% accuracy. Further classroom and industrial case studies provide additional evidence for Zorro\u2019s ability to support TDD recognition.\n"},{date:"2003 - 2007",project:"Software Project Telemetry",text:"Track process and product metrics automatically through software sensors.",url:"",media:"images/software-project-telemetry-small.png",bigImage:"images/software-project-telemetry-big.png",longText:"\nSoftware Project Telemetry is a project management technique that uses software sensors to collect metrics automatically and unobtrusively. It then employs a domain-specific language to represent telemetry trends in software product and process metrics. Project management and process improvement decisions are made by detecting changes in telemetry trends and comparing trends between different periods of the same project. Software project telemetry avoids many problems inherent in traditional metrics models, such as the need to accumulate a historical project database and ensure that the historical data remains comparable to current and future projects.\n\nEvaluation of software project telemetry provides evidence that it is an effective approach to (1) automated metrics collection and analysis, and (2) in-process, empirically-guided software development process problem detection and diagnosis. Two empirical studies were carried out to gather evidence: one in software engineering classes, and the other in the Collaborative Software Development Lab. The results suggested that software project telemetry had acceptably-low metrics collection and analysis overhead, and that it provided decision-making value at least in the exploratory context of the two studies.\n"},{date:"2007 - 2009",project:"Software ICU",text:'Rapidly assess the "health" of one or more projects.

In the real world, players participate in workshops, excursions, and creative events.  They compete to win prizes, and in the process, learn about their current behaviors and their impact on resources such as energy and water.  The online game environment allows players to earn points, achieve badges, increase their sustainability \u201cliteracy\u201d through readings and videos, and use social networking mechanisms to engage with friends and family. The Kukui Cup is designed to make the real and online world activities complementary and synergistic.\n\nKukui Cup challenges are typically designed with the following goals for its participants:\n\n  * Increase knowledge about sustainability issues;\n  * Gain insight about the impact of one\u2019s current behaviors and how to change them for increased sustainability;\n  * Build community, through awareness of local and national sustainability organizations and initiatives;\n  * Create commitment, from minor (turn off the lights when not in use) to major (pursue a profession related to sustainability).\n\nWe created short video \u201cmicro-documentaries\u201d for the various events in the 2012 Kukui at UH, which provide an interesting perspective on the game.

WattDepot is designed to help those of us in the middle: organizations who want to better manage their energy use, typically across multiple buildings.\n\nTo accomplish this, WattDepot provides data aggregation. For example, a building might have multiple meters monitoring energy consumption, one per floor. WattDepot can represent the power consumed by individual floors, as well as an aggregate source representing the building as a whole. Aggregations can be nested, so that floors can be aggregated into buildings, and buildings into campuses.\n\nWattDepot will run on all major operating systems. We provide an HTTP API which can be used by any modern programming language or environment to communicate with WattDepot servers. To simplify development, we provide client libraries for popular languages including Java, Javascript, and Python.\n\nWattDepot can support any meter that implements an HTTP-based protocol for data transmission. We provide bindings for the Shark 200s and Egauge meters.\n\nWattDepot is architecturally decoupled from its back-end storage system, allowing it to support both relational and NoSQL repositories.\n\nFor more information, please see [http://wattdepot.org](http://wattdepot.org).\n'},{date:"2014 - present",project:"Morea",text:"Generate educational websites organized by Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments.",url:"http://morea-framework.github.io/",media:"images/morea-module.png",bigImage:"images/morea-big.png",longText:'\nMorea implements a simple pedagogical design pattern: a course is a sequence of modules, each with one or more learning outcomes. Modules can combine one or more passive readings (providing background) with one or more active experiences (in-class work or homework). Finally, a module can contain one or more assessments to help students determine if they\'ve achieved the learning outcomes. These five representations: Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments form the acronym "Morea". \n\nOur experience shows that students and teachers both benefit by making this course design explicit. For example, Morea generates course websites that organize course content in multiple ways: by modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments. This makes it easier for teachers to design well structured courses, and easier for students to understand what they need to learn and how to learn it.\n\nIn addition, Morea makes it possible to represent dependencies between courses at the module-level. So, instead of saying that the course ICS 311 requires the courses ICS 241, 211, and 141, you can instead explicitly represent that the ICS 311 module called "Growth of Functions" depends upon the modules "Algorithms" from ICS 141, "Big-O Notation" from ICS 211, and "Advanced Counting Techniques" from ICS 241. To see this in action, check out [the ICS 311 Growth of Functions module](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ReviewICS311/modules/growth/).  Module-level dependency representation makes it easier to answer questions like "What should be the content of the core curriculum?"  The answer could be: "only those modules that are actually required by later modules in the curriculum." \n\nFor more information, please see [http://morea-framework.github.io/](http://morea-framework.github.io/).\n'},{date:"2013 - present",project:"Open Power Quality",text:"Open source hardware and software for low-cost distributed power quality data collection, analysis, and visualization.",url:"https://openpowerquality.org/",media:"images/opqlogo.png",bigImage:"images/opq-big.png",longText:'\nThe Open Power Quality project began in 2012 with the goal of developing and evaluating technology to support three important improvements to electrical infrastructure: \n\n  1.
